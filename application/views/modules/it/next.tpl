        <p>The <strong>NeXT Computer</strong> was a workstation computer developed, manufactured, and sold by {'NeXT'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc., a company founded by {'Steve Jobs'|link_urls:'/p'} and several other veterans of the {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} and Lisa teams, from 1988 until 1990.</p>
        <p>It ran the Unix-based {'NeXTSTEP'|link_urls:'i'} operating system, with a unique {'GUI'|link_urls:'i'} using a Display PostScript based back end.</p>
        <p>The motherboard was square and fit into one of four identical slots in the enclosure.</p>
        <p>The NeXT Computer enclosure consisted of a 1-foot (305 mm) die-cast magnesium cube-shaped, black case, which led to the machine being informally referred to as "<em>The Cube</em>".</p>
        <p>The NeXT Computer was not a great commercial success at the level of high volume personal computers such as the Apple II, the Macintosh, or Microsoft Windows PCs; some of the workstations were sold to universities, financial institutions, and government agencies however.</p>
        <p>A NeXT Computer and its object oriented development tools and libraries were used by {'Tim Berners-Lee'|link_urls:'/p'} and {'Robert Cailliau'|link_urls:'/p'} at {'CERN'|link_urls:'/c'} to develop the world's first {'web server'|link_urls:'w'} software, CERN HTTPd, and also used to write the first {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'}, {'WorldWideWeb'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>The NeXT Computer was succeeded by the NeXTcube, an upgraded model, in 1990.</p>
