        {'Amstrad PC 1512'|helper:'page':'getImage':'jpg':'left':NULL:TRUE}
        <p>The <strong>Amstrad PC1512</strong> was {'Amstrad'|link_urls:'/c'}'s mostly {'IBM PC compatible'|link_urls:'i'} computer system, first manufactured in 1986.</p>
        <p>It was later succeeded by the <strong>PC1640</strong>.</p>
        <p>It launched for 499GBP and sold very well, as it was one of the first cheap PCs in Europe.</p>
        <p>It significantly helped open up the European PC market to consumers as well as businesses, and Amstrad's advertising of the PC1512 was aimed at homes rather than offices.</p>
        <p>The 1512's influence was such that the UK PC magazine <strong>PC Plus</strong> originally targeted itself at the "<em>Amstrad PC 1512 and compatibles</em>", since home ownership of other PCs at the time was rare.</p>
        <p>The PC1512 shipped with 512K of RAM; it could be upgraded to 640K of RAM with an expansion pack commonly known as a "<em>top hat</em>".</p>
        <p>Video output was compatible with the {'CGA'|link_urls:'i'} standard, with an extension allowing all 16 colours to be used in the 640x200 graphics mode.</p>
        <p>The CPU of both the PC1512 and the later PC1640 was an 8 MHz Intel {'8086'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>The power supply was located in the monitor, which made upgrading difficult.</p>
        <p>Amstrad licensed both {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'} 3.2 and Digital Research DOS Plus, which was largely compatible with MS-DOS and included some features from {'CP/M'|link_urls:'i'} and the ability to read CP/M disks. Only one of these operating systems could be used at a time.</p>
        <p>They also licensed the {'GEM'|link_urls:'i'} windowing system, which supported the customized CGA hardware of the 1512.</p>
        {'Amstrad PC 1640'|helper:'page':'getImage':'jpg':'right':NULL:TRUE}
        <p>The PC1512 was followed by the PC1640, which had 640 KB of RAM and an {'EGA'|link_urls:'i'} compatible graphics chipset (though only the ECD model could display all EGA modes).</p>
        <p>Either model shipped with one or two 5.25" floppy drives, and optionally a hard drive (either 10M or 20M).</p>
        <p>The input devices supplied with the machine were notable.</p>
        <p>The mouse was an Amstrad Mouse, which was incompatible with serial mice common at the time.</p>
        <p>It was supported by some games, including Elite, but many DOS programs had problems with it.</p>
        <p>The keyboard sported an Atari-compatible joystick port for digital joysticks.</p>
        <p>Joystick movements and buttons were mapped to unused keyboard codes, allowing the joystick to be used in many DOS games that were written for keyboard control.</p>
        <p>The series was somewhat unusual for the fact that it had a physical volume control on the internal speaker.</p>
        <p>This allowed the user to make the machine beep quietly, or silently, from boot time onwards.</p>
