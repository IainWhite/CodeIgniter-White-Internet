        <p><strong>ARM</strong> is a family of instruction set architectures for computer processors based on a Reduced Instruction Set Computing {'RISC'|link_urls:'i'}) architecture developed by British company ARM Holdings.</p>
        <p>A RISC-based computer design approach means ARM processors require significantly fewer transistors than typical CISC {'x86'|link_urls:'i'} processors in most personal computers.</p>
        <p>This approach reduces costs, heat and power use. These are desirable traits for light, portable, battery-powered devices including smartphones, laptops, tablet and notepad computers, and other embedded systems.</p>
        <p>A simpler design facilitates more efficient multi-core CPUs and higher core counts at lower cost, providing improved energy efficiency for servers.</p>

        <p>The British computer manufacturer {'Acorn'|link_urls:'/c'} Computers first developed ARM in the 1980s to use in its personal computers.</p>
        <p>Its first ARM-based products were coprocessor modules for the {'BBC Micro'|link_urls:'i'} series of computers.</p>
        <p>After the successful BBC Micro computer, Acorn Computers considered how to move on from the relatively simple MOS Technology {'6502'|link_urls:'i'} processor to address business markets like the one that was soon dominated by the {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'}, launched in 1981.</p>
        <p>The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) plan required that a number of second processors be made to work with the BBC Micro platform, but processors such as the Motorola {'68000'|link_urls:'i'} and National Semiconductor 32016 were considered unsuitable, and the 6502 was not powerful enough for a graphics based user interface.</p>
