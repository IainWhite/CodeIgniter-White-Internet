        <p><strong>Slackware</strong> is a free and open source {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'} distribution.</p>
        <p>It was one of the earliest operating systems to be built on top of the Linux kernel and is the oldest currently being maintained.</p>
        <p>Slackware was created by Patrick Volkerding of Slackware Linux, Inc. in 1993.</p>
        <p>Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity, and to be the most "Unix-like" Linux distribution, making as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and using plain text files and a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration</p>
