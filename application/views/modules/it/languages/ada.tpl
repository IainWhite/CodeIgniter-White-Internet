        <p><strong>Ada</strong> is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from {'Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'} and other languages. It has built-in language support for explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism.</p>
        <p>Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.</p>
        <p>Ada was originally designed by a team led by {'Jean Ichbiah'|link_urls:'/p'} of CII Honeywell Bull under contract to the United States Department of Defense (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by the DoD.</p>
        <p>Ada was named after {'Ada Lovelace'|link_urls:'/p'} (1815 â€“ 1852), who is credited as being the first computer programmer.</p>
