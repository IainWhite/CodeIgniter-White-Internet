        <p><strong>Turbo Basic</strong> is a {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} compiler and dialect originally created by <strong>Robert "Bob" Zale</strong> and bought from him by {'Borland'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>When Borland decided to stop publishing it, Zale bought it back from them, renamed it to {'PowerBASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} and set up <strong>PowerBASIC Inc.</strong> to continue support and development of it.</p>
        <p>Borland's Turbo Basic contains extensions to classical BASIC (while not breaking compatibility). One of those are drawing API, and mouse access.</p>
        <p>Unlike most BASIC implementations of this period, Turbo Basic was a full compiler which generated native code for {'MS DOS'|link_urls:'i'}. Other implementations were either interpreters, or relied heavily on a runtime library.</p>
        <p>The Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) could run a BASIC program internally for traditional BASIC debugging, or generate an MS-DOS stand-alone executable file that could be run on other systems without the Turbo Basic product or runtime libraries.</p>
