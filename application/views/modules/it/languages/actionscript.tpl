        <p><strong>ActionScript</strong> is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by {'Macromedia'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc. (now owned by {'Adobe'|link_urls:'/c'} Systems).</p>
        <p>It is a dialect of {'ECMAScript'|link_urls:'/l'} (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'}), and is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe {'Flash Player'|link_urls:'i'} platform, used on Web pages in the form of embedded SWF files.</p>
        <p>ActionScript 3 is also used with the <strong>Adobe Integrated Runtime</strong> ({'AIR'|link_urls:'i'})system for the development of desktop and mobile applications.</p>
