        <p><strong>Object Pascal</strong> refers to a branch of object-oriented derivatives of {'Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal is an extension of the Pascal language that was developed at {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Computer by a team led by Larry Tesler in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of Pascal.</p>
        <p>It is descended from an earlier object-oriented version of Pascal called <strong>Clascal</strong>, which was available on the Lisa computer.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal was needed in order to support MacApp, an expandable {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} application framework that would now be called a class library.</p>
        <p>Object Pascal extensions and MacApp itself were developed by Barry Haynes, Ken Doyle, and Larry Rosenstein, and were tested by Dan Allen.</p>
        <p>Larry Tesler oversaw the project, which began very early in 1985 and became a product in 1986.</p>
        <p>In 1986, {'Borland'|link_urls:'/c'} introduced similar extensions, also called Object Pascal, to the {'Turbo Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'} product for the Macintosh, and in 1989 for Turbo Pascal 5.5 for DOS.</p>
        <p>When Borland refocused from {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} to {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} in 1994, they created a successor to Turbo Pascal, called {'Delphi'|link_urls:'/l'} and introduced a new set of extensions to create what is now known as the Delphi language.</p>
