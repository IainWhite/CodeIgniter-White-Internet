        <p><strong>Mallard BASIC</strong> is a {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} interpreter for {'CP/M'|link_urls:'i'} written by <strong>Locomotive Software</strong> and supplied with the {'Amstrad PCW'|link_urls:'i'} range of small business computers, the ZX Spectrum +3 version of CP/M Plus, and the Acorn {'BBC Micro'|link_urls:'i'} Z80 second Processor.</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, it was standard industry practice to bundle a BASIC interpreter with microcomputers, and the PCW followed this practice. While it was primarily a wordprocessor for business use, it was not a dedicated WP: it also ran the CP/M operating system.</p>
