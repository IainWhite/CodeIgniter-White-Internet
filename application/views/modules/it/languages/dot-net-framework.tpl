        <p><strong>.NET Framework</strong> (pronounced <em>dot net</em>) is a software framework developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} that runs primarily on {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It includes a large library and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages.</p>
        <p>Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling.</p>
        <p>The class library and the CLR together constitute .NET Framework.</p>
        <p>.NET Framework's Framework Class Library provides user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications.</p>
        <p>Programmers produce software by combining their own source code with .NET Framework and other libraries.</p>
        <p>.NET Framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment largely for .NET software called {'Visual Studio'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Microsoft started development of .NET Framework in the late 1990s, originally under the name of <strong>Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS)</strong>.</p>
        <p>By late 2000, the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released.</p>
        <p>Version 3.0 of .NET Framework is included with Windows Server 2008 and {'Windows Vista'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Version 3.5 is included with {'Windows 7'|link_urls:'i'} and Windows Server 2008 R2, and can also be installed on {'Windows XP'|link_urls:'i'} and Windows Server 2003.</p>
        <p>On 12 April 2010, .NET Framework 4 was released alongside Visual Studio 2010.</p>
