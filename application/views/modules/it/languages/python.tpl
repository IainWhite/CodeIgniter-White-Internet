        <p><strong>Python</strong> is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.</p>
        <p>Its design philosophy emphasises code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as {'C'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
        <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.</p>
        <p>Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.</p>
