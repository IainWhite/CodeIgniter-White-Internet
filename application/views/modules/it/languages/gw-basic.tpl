        <p><strong>GW-BASIC</strong> is a dialect of the programming language {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} from BASICA, originally for {'Compaq'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>It is otherwise identical to Microsoft/IBM BASICA, but is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the ROM BASIC.</p>
        <p>It was bundled with {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'} operating systems on {'IBM PC compatibles'|link_urls:'i'} by Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Microsoft also sold a BASIC compiler, BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed.</p>
        <p>Since it was included with most versions of MS-DOS, it was also a low cost way for many would-be programmers to learn the fundamentals of computer programming.</p>
        <p>With the release of MS-DOS 5.0, GW-BASIC's place was eventually taken by {'QBasic'|link_urls:'/l'}, the interpreter part of the separately available {'QuickBASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} compiler.</p>
        <p>There are several theories on what the initials "<em>GW</em>" stand for.</p>
        <p><strong>Greg Whitten</strong>, an early Microsoft employee who developed the standards in the company's BASIC compiler line, says {'Bill Gates'|link_urls:'/p'} picked the name GW-BASIC.</p>
        <p>Whitten refers to it as <em>Gee-Whiz BASIC</em> and is unsure if Gates named the program after him.</p>
        <p>It may have also been nicknamed <em>Gee-Whiz</em> because it had a large number of graphics commands.</p>
        <p>Other common theories as to the initials' origins include "<em>Graphics and Windows</em>", "<em>Gates, William</em>" (Microsoft's president at the time), or "<em>Gates, Whitten</em>" (the two main designers of the program).</p>
