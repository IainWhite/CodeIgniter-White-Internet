        <p><strong>Delphi</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) for console, desktop graphical, web, and mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Delphi's compilers use their own {'Object Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'} dialect of {'Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'} and generate native code for 32 and 64-bit {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} operating systems, as well as 32-bit Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'} and {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Delphi was originally developed by {'Borland'|link_urls:'/c'} as a Rapid Application Development ({'RAD'|link_urls:'m'}) tool for Windows, and as the successor of {'Turbo Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>In 2006, Borlandâ€™s developer tools section were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary known as <strong>CodeGear</strong>, which was sold to <strong>Embarcadero Technologies</strong> in 2008.</p>
        <p>Borland developer Danny Thorpe suggested the <em>Delphi</em> codename in reference to the <strong>Oracle at Delphi</strong>.</p>
        <p>One of the design goals of the product was to provide database connectivity to programmers as a key feature and a popular database package at the time was {'Oracle'|link_urls:'w'} database; hence, "<em>If you want to talk to [the] Oracle, go to Delphi</em>".</p>
