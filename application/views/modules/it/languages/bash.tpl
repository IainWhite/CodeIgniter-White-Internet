        <p><strong>Bash</strong> is a {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} shell written by {'Brian Fox'|link_urls:'/p'} for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the {'Bourne shell'|link_urls:'/l'} (sh).</p>
        <p>Released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'} and Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It has been ported to {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} and distributed with {'Cygwin'|link_urls:'i'} and MinGW, to {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} by the DJGPP project, to Novell NetWare {'NetWare'|link_urls:'i'} and to Android via various terminal emulation applications.</p>
        <p>Bash is a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. Bash can also read commands from a file, called a script.</p>
        <p>Like all Unix shells, it supports filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.</p>
        <p>The name itself is an acronym, a pun, and a description.</p>
        <p>As an acronym, it stands for Bourne-again shell, referring to its objective as a free replacement for the Bourne shell.</p>
        <p>As a pun, it expressed that objective in a phrase that sounds similar to born again, a term for spiritual rebirth.</p>
        <p>The name is also descriptive of what it did, bashing together the features of {'Bourne shell'|link_urls:'/l'} (sh), {'C shell'|link_urls:'/l'} (csh), and {'Korn shell'|link_urls:'/l'} (ksh).</p>
