        <p>The <strong>Lattice C Compiler</strong> was released in June 1982 by <strong>Lifeboat Associates</strong> and was the first {'C'|link_urls:'/l'} compiler for the {'IBM Personal Computer'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>The compiler sold for $500 and would run on {'PC DOS'|link_urls:'i'} or {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>The hardware requirements were 96K of RAM and two floppy drives.</p>
        <p>It was ported to many other platforms, such as mainframes (MVS), minicomputers ({'VMS'|link_urls:'i'}), workstations ({'UNIX'|link_urls:'i'}), {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'}, the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sinclair QL.</p>
        <p>The compiler was subsequently repackaged by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} under a distribution agreement as <strong>Microsoft C</strong> version 2.0.</p>
        <p>Microsoft developed their own C compiler that was released in April 1985 as Microsoft C Compiler 3.0.</p>
        <p>Lattice was purchased by <strong>SAS Institute</strong> in 1987. After this, support for other platforms dwindled until compiler development ceased for all platforms except {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} mainframes.</p>
        <p>The product is still available in versions that run on other platforms, but these are cross compilers that only produce mainframe code.</p>
