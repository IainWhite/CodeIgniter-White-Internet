        <p><strong>ECMAScript</strong> is the scripting language standardized by <strong>Ecma International</strong> in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262.</p>
        <p>The language is widely used for client-side scripting on the web, in the form of several well-known implementations such as {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'JScript'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'ActionScript'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>JavaScript was originally developed by {'Brendan Eich'|link_urls:'/p'} of {'Netscape'|link_urls:'/c'} under the name <strong>Mocha</strong>, later <strong>LiveScript</strong>, and finally renamed to <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
        <p>In December 1995, {'Sun'|link_urls:'/c'} Microsystems and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release.</p>
        <p>In March 1996, {'Netscape Navigator'|link_urls:'w'} 2.0 was released, featuring support for JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Owing to the widespread success of JavaScript as a client-side scripting language for web pages, {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} developed a compatible dialect of the language, naming it {'JScript'|link_urls:'/l'} to avoid trademark issues.</p>
        <p>JScript added new date methods to fix the non-Y2K-friendly methods in JavaScript, which were based on the Java Date class.</p>
        <p>JScript was included in {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'} 3.0, released in August 1996.</p>
        <p>Microsoft delivered JScript to Ecma International for standardization and the work on the specification, ECMA-262, began in November 1996.</p>
        <p>The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then.</p>
        <p>ECMAScript is the name of the scripting language standardized in ECMA-262.</p>
        <p>The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between the organizations involved in standardizing the language, especially Netscape and Microsoft, whose disputes dominated the early standards sessions.</p>
        <p>Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, commented that "<em>ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease</em>".</p>
        <p>While both JavaScript and JScript aim to be compatible with ECMAScript, they also provide additional features not described in the ECMA specifications.</p>
