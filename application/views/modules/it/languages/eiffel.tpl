        <p><strong>Eiffel</strong> is an {'ISO'|link_urls:'/c'} standardized, object-oriented programming language designed by <strong>Bertrand Meyer</strong> (an object-orientation proponent and author of <strong>Object-Oriented Software Construction</strong>) and Eiffel Software.</p>
        <p>The design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command-query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open-closed principle, and option-operand separation.</p>
        <p>Many concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into {'Java'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'C#'|link_urls:'/l'}, and other languages.</p>
