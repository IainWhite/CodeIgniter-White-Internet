        <p><strong>Visual Basic</strong> is a third-generation event-driven programming language and Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) from {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} for its COM programming model first released in 1991.</p>
        <p>Microsoft intends Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use.</p>
        <p>Visual Basic was derived from {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} and enables the rapid application development ({'RAD'|link_urls:'m'}) of graphical user interface ({'GUI'|link_urls:'i'}) applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or {'ActiveX'|link_urls:'i'} Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.</p>
        <p>A programmer can create an application using the components provided by the Visual Basic program itself.</p>
        <p>Over time the community of programmers have developed new third party components, keeping this programming language to modern standards.</p>
        <p>Programs written in Visual Basic can also use the {'Windows API'|link_urls:'i'}, which requires external function declarations.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, new third party functions (which are open source) using part <strong>VB6</strong> source code and part embedded machine code, make the Visual Basic 6.0 applications faster than those designed in {'C++'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>The final release was version 6 in 1998 (now known simply as Visual Basic).</p>
        <p>Though Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is unsupported as of 8 April 2008, the Visual Basic team is committed to “It Just Works” compatibility for Visual Basic 6.0 applications on {'Windows Vista'|link_urls:'i'}, Windows Server 2008 including R2, {'Windows 7'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'Windows 8'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>A dialect of Visual Basic, <strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong> ({'VBA'|link_urls:'/l'}), is used as a macro or scripting language within several {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} applications, including {'Microsoft Office'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
