        <p><strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong> (<strong>VBA</strong>) is an implementation of Microsoft's event-driven programming language {'Visual Basic'|link_urls:'/l'} 6 and its associated Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}).</p>
        <p>Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes and accessing {'Windows API'|link_urls:'i'} and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).</p>
        <p>It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBasic.</p>
        <p>It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, VBA is closely related to Visual Basic and uses the Visual Basic Runtime Library, but it can normally only run code within a host application rather than as a standalone program.</p>
        <p>It can, however, be used to control one application from another via OLE Automation.</p>
        <p>VBA has the ability to use (but not create) (ActiveX/COM) DLLs, and later versions add support for class modules.</p>
        <p>VBA is built into most {'Microsoft Office'|link_urls:'i'} applications, including Office for Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} (apart from version 2008) and other {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} applications such as Microsoft MapPoint and Microsoft {'Visio'|link_urls:'i'}, as well as being at least partially implemented in other applications such as ArcGIS, AutoCAD, CATIA and WordPerfect.</p>
