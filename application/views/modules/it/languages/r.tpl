        <p><strong>R</strong> is a free software programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.</p>
        <p>The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.</p>
        <p>R is an implementation of the {'S'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by {'John Chambers'|link_urls:'/p'} while at {'Bell Labs'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>R was created by {'Ross Ihaka'|link_urls:'/p'} and {'Robert Gentleman'|link_urls:'/p'} at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the <strong>R Development Core Team</strong>, of which Chambers is a member.</p>
        <p>R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S.</p>
        <p>R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems.</p>
        <p>R uses a command line interface; however, several graphical user interfaces are available for use with R.</p>
