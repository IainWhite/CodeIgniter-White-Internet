        <p><strong>Microsoft QuickBASIC</strong> (also <strong>QB</strong>) is an Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) and compiler for the {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language that was developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>QuickBASIC runs mainly on {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, though there was a short-lived version for Mac OS.</p>
        <p>It is loosely based on {'GW-BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the interpreter.</p>
        <p>Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System.</p>
