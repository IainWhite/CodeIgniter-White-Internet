        <p><strong>Super Video Graphics Array</strong> or <strong>Ultra Video Graphics Array</strong>, almost always abbreviated to <strong>Super VGA</strong>, <strong>Ultra VGA</strong> or just <strong>SVGA</strong> or <strong>UVGA</strong> is a broad term that covers a wide range of computer display standards.</p>
        <p>Originally, it was an extension to the {'VGA'|link_urls:'i'} standard first released by {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} in 1987.</p>
        <p>Unlike VGA a purely IBM defined standard Super VGA was never formally defined.</p>
        <p>The closest to an "official" definition was in the VBE extensions defined by the <strong>Video Electronics Standards Association</strong> (<strong>VESA</strong>), an open consortium set up to promote interoperability and define standards.</p>
        <p>In this document, there was simply a footnote stating that "<em>The term 'Super VGA' is used in this document for a graphics display controller implementing any superset of the standard IBM VGA display adapter.</em>"</p>
        <p>When used as a resolution specification, in contrast to VGA or XGA for example, the term SVGA normally refers to a resolution of 800x600 pixels.</p>
