        <p>A <strong>Local Area Network</strong> (<strong>LAN</strong>) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building using network media.</p>
        <p>The defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to wide area networks ({'WAN'|link_urls:'i'}s), include their smaller geographic area, and non-inclusion of leased telecommunication lines.</p>
        <p>{'ARCNET'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Token Ring'|link_urls:'i'} and other technology standards have been used in the past, but {'Ethernet'|link_urls:'i'} over twisted pair cabling, and {'Wi-Fi'|link_urls:'i'} are the two most common technologies currently used to build LANs.</p>
