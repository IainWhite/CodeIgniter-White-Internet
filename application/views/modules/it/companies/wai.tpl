        <p>The <strong>World Wide Web Consortium ({'W3C'|link_urls:'/c'})'s</strong> <strong>Web Accessibility Initiative</strong> (<strong>WAI</strong>) is an effort to improve the {'accessibility'|link_urls:'w'} of the {'World Wide Web'|link_urls:'w'} for people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web.</p>
        <p>Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources.</p>
        <p>The W3C launched the Web Accessibility Initiative in 1997 with endorsement by The White House and W3C members.</p>
