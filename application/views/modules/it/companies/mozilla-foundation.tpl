        <p><strong>The Mozilla Foundation</strong> is a non-profit organization that exists to support and lead the open source Mozilla project.</p>
        <p>Founded in July 2003, the organization sets the policies that govern development, operates key infrastructure and controls Mozilla trademarks and copyrights.</p>
        <p>It owns a taxable subsidiary: the Mozilla Corporation, which employs many Mozilla developers and coordinates releases of the {'Mozilla Firefox'|link_urls:'w'} web browser and {'Mozilla Thunderbird'|link_urls:'i'} email client.</p>
        <p>The subsidiary is 100% owned by the parent, and therefore follows the same non-profit principles.</p>
        <p>The Mozilla Foundation was founded by the Netscape-affiliated Mozilla Organization.</p>
        <p>The organization is currently based in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, California, USA.</p>
