        <p><strong>Spyglass, Inc.</strong> was an Internet software company based in Champaign, Illinois.</p>
        <p>The company, founded in 1990, was an offshoot of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and created to commercialize and support technologies from the <strong>National Center for Supercomputing Applications ({'NCSA'|link_urls:'/c'})</strong>.</p>
        <p>For several years, it focused on data visualization tools, such as graphing packages and 3D rendering engines.</p>
        <p>In May 1994, Spyglass licensed NCSA's {'Mosaic'|link_urls:'w'} browser, with the intent to develop their own {'Web browser'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>However, NCSA's development effort had resulted in different features, user interfaces, and codebases for each of its major platforms: {'UNIX'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'Mac OS'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Spyglass therefore created its own Mosaic codebase in which most source code and all features were shared between platforms.</p>
        <p>Spyglass Mosaic's codebase was then licensed to {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} and became the basis for their {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
