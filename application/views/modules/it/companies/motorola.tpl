        <p><strong>Motorola Inc.</strong> is one of the leading manufacturers of microprocessors.</p>
        <p>Until the early 1990s, Motorola microprocessors were used in all {'Apple Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} computers and in many workstations.</p>
        <p>Following the development of its 68040 chip in 1989, however, Motorola changed its focus from the 680x0 line of CISC chips to {'RISC'|link_urls:'i'} technologies.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Motorola joined {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Computer and {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} in designing a new RISC architecture that would form the basis of the next generation of personal computers.</p>
        <p>This effort culminated in the introduction of the {'PowerPC'|link_urls:'i'} architecture in 1994.</p>
