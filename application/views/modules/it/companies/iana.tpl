        <p>The <strong>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</strong> (<strong>IANA</strong>) is a department of {'ICANN'|link_urls:'/c'}, a nonprofit private American corporation, which oversees global {'IP address'|link_urls:'w'} allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System ({'DNS'|link_urls:'w'}), media types, and other Internet Protocol related symbols and numbers.</p>
        <p>Prior to the establishment of ICANN primarily for this purpose in 1998, IANA was administered principally by Jon Postel at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern California (USC) situated at Marina Del Ray (Los Angeles), under a contract USC/ISI had with the United States Department of Defense, until ICANN was created to assume the responsibility under a United States Department of Commerce contract.</p>
