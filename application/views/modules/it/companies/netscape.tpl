        <p><strong>Netscape Communications</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Netscape Communications Corporation</strong> and commonly known as <strong>Netscape</strong>) is a US computer services company, best known for {'Netscape Navigator'|link_urls:'w'}, its {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>When it was an independent company, its headquarters were in Mountain View, California.</p>
        <p>Netscape's web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share, but lost most of that share to {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'} during the {'first browser war'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>Netscape is credited with developing the Secure Sockets Layer Protocol {'SSL'|link_urls:'w'} for securing on-line communication, which is still widely used, as well as {'javaScript'|link_urls:'/l'}, the most widely used language for client-side scripting of web pages.</p>
        <p>Netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by {'AOL'|link_urls:'/c'} in a pooling-of-interests transaction ultimately worth US$10 billion.</p>
        <p>Shortly before its acquisition by AOL, Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product.</p>
        <p>The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser's source code based on the Gecko rendering engine; all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code.</p>
        <p>The Gecko engine would later be used to power the Mozilla Foundation's {'Firefox'|link_urls:'w'} browser.</p>
        <p>Under AOL, Netscape's browser development continued until December 2007, when Tom Drapeau, director of AOL's Netscape Brand, announced that the company would stop supporting Netscape software products as of 1 February 1, 2008.</p>
