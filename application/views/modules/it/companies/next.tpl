        <p><strong>NeXT, Inc.</strong> (later <strong>NeXT Computer, Inc.</strong> and <strong>NeXT Software, Inc.</strong>) was an American computer company head-quartered in Redwood City, California, that developed and manufactured a series of computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets.</p>
        <p>NeXT was founded in 1985 by {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Computer co-founder {'Steve Jobs'|link_urls:'/p'}, after he was forced out of Apple, along with a few of his co-workers.</p>
        <p>NeXT introduced the first {'NeXT'|link_urls:'i'} Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990.</p>
        <p>The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, its innovative object-oriented {'NextSTEP'|link_urls:'i'} operating system and development environment were highly influential.</p>
