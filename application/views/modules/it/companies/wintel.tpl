        <p><strong>WinTel</strong> is term that references a {'PC'|link_urls:'i'}built with an {'Intel'|link_urls:'/c'} microprocessor and a {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} OS.</p>
        <p>WinTel's architecture, which remains the dominant desktop and laptop platform, is commonly known as WinTel computing.</p>
        <p>By 1984, Microsoft experienced explosive growth and revenue from its disk operating system {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} sale to {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} and other PC manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In 1987, IBM made disastrous manufacturing and marketing mistakes when the company manufactured non-{'IBM compatible PC'|link_urls:'i'}s, including the {'PS/2'|link_urls:'i'} computer line.</p>
        <p>While other manufacturers made technological strides, IBM lost its leading position.</p>
        <p>By the early 1990s, {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} and {'Intel'|link_urls:'/c'} excelled with central processing unit ({'CPU'|link_urls:'i'}) and OS sales, while IBM suffered massive financial losses.</p>
        <p>Intel grew, and at one time it was the largest global manufacturer of motherboards and one of a few chipset manufacturers.</p>
