        <p>It commenced operations in May 1995, had its initial public offering on NASDAQ (trading ticker ALLR) in January 1999, and was acquired by rival {'Macromedia'|link_urls:'/c'} in early 2001.</p>
        <p>Allaire released the first version of the {'ColdFusion'|link_urls:'/l'} server in 1995, the first database-driven web-content server.</p>

        <p>In 2000, Allaire acquired Live Software, a company founded by Paul Colton in 1997 and best known for the creation of the first commercial Java Servlet and {'JSP'|link_urls:'/l'} server, <strong>JRun</strong>.</p>
        <p>Later in 2000, Allaire also acquired the <strong>Kawa IDE</strong> (Java IDE) from Tek-Tools Software and much of the Kawa development team relocated from Dallas to Boston.</p>
        <p>Allaire also produced an early web <strong>Content Management System</strong> ({'CMS'|link_urls:'i'}) called <strong>Spectra</strong>.</p>
        <p>JRun was purchased by {'Macromedia'|link_urls:'/c'}, which in 2001 also purchased Allaire. In 2005, Macromedia was purchased by {'Adobe'|link_urls:'/c'} Systems.</p>
