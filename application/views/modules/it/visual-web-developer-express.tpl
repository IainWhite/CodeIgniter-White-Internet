        <p><strong>Visual Web Developer Express</strong> is a freeware web development tool, that allows developers to evaluate the web development and editing capabilities of the other {'Visual studio'|link_urls:'i'} editions at no charge.</p>
        <p>Its main function is to create ASP.NET websites.</p>
        <p>It has a WYSIWYG interface, drag-and-drop user interface designer, enhanced {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'} and code editors, a limited database explorer, support for {'CSS'|link_urls:'w'}, {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'XML'|link_urls:'w'}, and integrated, design-time validation for standards including XHTML 1.0/1.1 and CSS 2.1.</p>
        <p>Visual Web Developer 2005 Express lacks certain features, such as the Accessibility Checker, the ability to create standalone class library projects, third-party add-ins and macros.</p>
        <p>Visual Web Developer 2008 Express SP1 supports both class library and web application projects.</p>
        <p>It also includes a new integrated HTML designer based on Microsoft Expression Web. However, this edition cannot publish self-developed websites.</p>
