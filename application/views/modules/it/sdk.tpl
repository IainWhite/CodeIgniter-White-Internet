        <p>A <strong>Software Development Kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong> or "<em>devkit</em>") is typically a set of software development tools that allows for the creation of applications for a certain software package, software framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or similar development platform.</p>
        <p>It may be something as simple as the implementation of one or more application programming interfaces ({'API'|link_urls:'i'}s) in the form of some libraries to interface to a particular programming language or to include sophisticated hardware that can communicate with a particular embedded system.</p>
        <p>Common tools include debugging facilities and other utilities, often presented in an integrated development environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}).</p>
        <p>SDKs also frequently include sample code and supporting technical notes or other supporting documentation to help clarify points made by the primary reference material.</p>
