        <p><strong>TeX</strong> is a typesetting system designed and mostly written by {'Donald Knuth'|link_urls:'/p'} and released in 1978.</p>
        <p>Together with the {'Metafont'|link_urls:'i'} language for {'font'|link_urls:'i'} description and the {'Computer Modern'|link_urls:'i'} family of {'typefaces'|link_urls:'i'}, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonably minimal amount of effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, now and in the future.</p>
        <p>TeX is a popular means by which to typeset complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems in the world.</p>
        <p>TeX is popular in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, engineering, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology.</p>
