        <p>The <strong>Acorn Archimedes</strong> was {'Acorn'|link_urls:'/c'} Computers' first general purpose home computer to be based on their own {'ARM architecture'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Using a {'RISC'|link_urls:'i'} design with a 32-bit CPU (26-bit addressing), at its launch in June 1987, the Archimedes was stated as running at 4 MIPS, with a claim of 18 MIPS during tests.</p>
        <p>The name is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture, even where Acorn did not include Archimedes in the official name.</p>
        <p>The Archimedes was one of the most powerful home computers available during the late 1980s and early 1990s; its main CPU was faster than the Motorola {'68000'|link_urls:'i'} microprocessors found in the more popular Commodore Amiga and Atari ST machines.</p>
