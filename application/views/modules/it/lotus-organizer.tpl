        <p><strong>Lotus Organizer</strong> was a personal information manager (PIM).</p>
        <p>It was initially developed by <strong>Threadz</strong>, a small British software house, reaching version 3.0.</p>
        <p>Organizer was subsequently acquired by {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Development Corporation, for whom the package was a Windows-based replacement for {'Lotus Agenda'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by {'Microsoft Outlook'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Organizer is notable for using the "leather-bound personal organizer" graphical metaphor for its user interface.</p>
        <p>It was bundled within {'Lotus SmartSuite'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
