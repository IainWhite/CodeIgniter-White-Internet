        <p><strong>Cocoa</strong> is {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'}'s native object-oriented application programming interface ({'API'|link_urls:'i'}) for the {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} operating system.</p>
        <p>For {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'}, there is a similar API called {'Cocoa Touch'|link_urls:'i'} which includes gesture recognition, animation, and a different user interface library, and is for applications for the iOS operating system, used on Apple devices such as {'iPhone'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iPad'|link_urls:'i'}, iPod Touch and Apple TV.</p>
        <p>Cocoa consists of the Foundation Kit, Application Kit, and Core Data frameworks, as included by <code>Cocoa.h</code> header file, as well as the libraries and frameworks included by those, such as the {'C'|link_urls:'/l'} standard library and the {'Objective-C'|link_urls:'/l'} runtime.</p>
        <p>Cocoa applications are typically developed using the development tools provided by Apple, specifically {'Xcode'|link_urls:'i'} (formerly <strong>Project Builder</strong>) and Interface Builder, using the Objective-C language.</p>
        <p>However, the Cocoa programming environment can be accessed using other tools, such as Clozure CL, LispWorks, {'Object Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Python'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Perl'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Ruby'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'AppleScript'|link_urls:'/l'} with the aid of bridging mechanisms such as PasCocoa, PyObjC, CamelBones, RubyCocoa and D/Objective-C Bridge.</p>
        <p>For end-users, Cocoa applications are those written using the Cocoa programming environment. Such applications usually have a distinctive feel, since the Cocoa programming environment automates many aspects of an application to comply with Apple's human interface guidelines.</p>
