        <p>The <strong>Colour Graphics Adapter</strong> (<strong>CGA</strong>), originally also called the Colour/Graphics Adapter or IBM Colour/Graphics Monitor Adapter, introduced in 1981, was IBM's first graphics card and first colour display card for the {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'}. For this reason, it also became the first colour computer display standard.</p>
        <p>The standard {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} CGA graphics card was equipped with 16 kilobytes of video memory and could be connected either to a dedicated direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) "RGBI" interface, such as the IBM 5153 colour display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector.</p>
        <p>The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator.</p>
        <p>Built around the Motorola MC6845 display controller, the CGA card featured several graphics and text modes.</p>
        <p>The highest display resolution of any mode was 640x200, and the highest colour depth supported was 4-bit (16 colours).</p>
