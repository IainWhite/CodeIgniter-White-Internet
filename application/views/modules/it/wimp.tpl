        <p><strong>WIMP</strong> stands for "Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer", denoting a style of interaction using these elements of the user interface.</p>
        <p>It was coined by Merzouga Wilberts in 1980.</p>
        <p>Other expansions are sometimes used, substituting "mouse" and "mice" or "pull-down menu" and "pointing", for menus and pointer, respectively.</p>
        <p>Though the term has fallen into disuse, some use it incorrectly as an approximate synonym for Graphical User Interface ({'GUI'|link_urls:'i'}).</p>
        <p>Any interface that uses graphics can be called a GUI, and WIMP systems derive from such systems. However, while all WIMP systems use graphics as a key element (the icon and pointer elements), and therefore are GUIs, the reverse is not true.</p>
        <p>Some GUIs are not based in windows, icons, menus, and pointers. For example, most mobile phones represent actions as icons, and some may have menus, but very few include a pointer or run programs in a window.</p>
        <p>WIMP interaction was developed at {'Xerox PARC'|link_urls:'/c'} (see {'Xerox Alto'|link_urls:'i'}, developed in 1973) and popularized with {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'}'s introduction of the {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} in 1984, which added the concepts of the "menu bar" and extended window management.</p>
