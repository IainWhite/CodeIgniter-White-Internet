        <p><strong>IBM PC compatible</strong> computers are those similar to the original {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'}, {'XT'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'AT'|link_urls:'i'} and able to run the same software as those.</p>
        <p>Such computers used to be referred to as <strong>PC clones</strong>, or <strong>IBM clones</strong>.</p>
        <p>They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a "clean room design" technique.</p>
        <p>Most early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models.</p>
        <p>The IBM AT compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture bus by manufacturers of compatible computers.</p>
        <p>The term "<em>IBM PC compatible</em>" is now a historical description only, since {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} has ended its personal computer sales.</p>
