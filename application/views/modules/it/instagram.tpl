        <p><strong>Instagram</strong> is an online photo-sharing, video-sharing and {'social networking'|link_urls:'i'} service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, apply digital filters to them, and share them on a variety of social networking services, such as {'Facebook'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Twitter'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Tumblr'|link_urls:'w'} and {'Flickr'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>A distinctive feature is that it confines photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras.</p>
        <p>Users are also able to record and share short videos lasting for up to 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and launched in October 2010.</p>
        <p>The service rapidly gained popularity, with over 100 million active users as of April 2012.</p>
