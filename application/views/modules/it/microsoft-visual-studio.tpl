        <p><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) from {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>It is used to develop computer programs for {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} family of operating systems, as well as web sites, web applications and web services.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as {'Windows API'|link_urls:'i'}, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight.</p>
        <p>It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense as well as code refactoring.</p>
        <p>The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger.</p>
        <p>Other built-in tools include a forms designer for building {'GUI'|link_urls:'i'} applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer.</p>
        <p>It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source-control systems (like {'Subversion'|link_urls:'i'}) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Team Foundation Server client: Team Explorer).</p>
        <p>Visual Studio supports different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists.</p>
        <p>Built-in languages include {'C'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'C++'|link_urls:'/l'} and C++/CLI (via {'Visual C++'|link_urls:'/l'}), {'VB.NET'|link_urls:'/l'} (via Visual Basic .NET), {'C#'|link_urls:'/l'} (via Visual C#), and F# (as of Visual Studio 2010).</p>
        <p>Support for other languages such as {'Python'|link_urls:'/l'}, and {'Ruby'|link_urls:'/l'} among others is available via language services installed separately.</p>
        <p>It also supports {'XML'|link_urls:'w'}, {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'}, {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'CSS'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
