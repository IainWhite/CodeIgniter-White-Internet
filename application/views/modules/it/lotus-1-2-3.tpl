        <p><strong>Lotus 1-2-3</strong> is a spreadsheet program from {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Software (now part of {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'}).</p>
        <p>It was the IBM PCâ€™s first "<em>killer application</em>"; its huge popularity in the mid-1980s contributed significantly to the success of the {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'} in the corporate environment.</p>
        <p>The first spreadsheet, Visicalc, had helped launch the Apple II as one of the earliest personal computers in business use.</p>
        <p>With IBM's entry into the market, VisiCalc was slow to respond, and when they did, they launched what was essentially a straight port of their existing system in spite of the greatly expanded hardware capabilities. Lotus' solution was marketed as a three-in-one, integrated solution, which handled spreadsheet calculations, graphical charts, and database functionality - thus the name "1-2-3".</p>
        <p>1-2-3 quickly overtook VisiCalc, as well as MultiPlan and SuperCalc, two VisiCalc competitors.</p>
        <p>1-2-3 was the de-facto standard throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, part of a triumvirate of products that included {'dBASE'|link_urls:'w'} and {'WordPerfect'|link_urls:'i'} to build a complete small business platform.</p>
        <p>It was not until the acceptance of {'Windows 3'|link_urls:'i'} started to grow that the market began to change. None of these companies had seriously considered the graphical user interface in the {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}  era, and responded slowly to Microsoft's own products, {'Excel'|link_urls:'i'} and {'Word'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>As the early 1990s ended, 1-2-3 was in the number three position, and never recovered.</p>
        <p>IBM purchased Lotus and continued sales, only officially ending sales in 2013.</p>
