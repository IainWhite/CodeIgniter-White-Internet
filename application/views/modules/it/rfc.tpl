        <p>A <strong>Request for Comments</strong> (<strong>RFC</strong>) is a publication of the Internet Engineering Task Force ({'IETF'|link_urls:'/c'}) and the Internet Society, the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the {'Internet'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviours, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.</p>
        <p>It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humour.</p>
        <p>The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet standards.</p>
        <p>Request for Comments documents were invented by {'Stephen Crocker'|link_urls:'/p'} in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of {'ARPANET'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>RFCs have since become official documents of Internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events.</p>
