        <p><strong>WordPerfect</strong> is a word processing application owned by {'Corel'|link_urls:'/c'} with a long history on multiple personal computer platforms.</p>
        <p>The program was originally developed under contract at Brigham Young University for use on a Data General minicomputer in 1979.</p>
        <p>The authors retained the rights to the program, forming Satellite Systems International (SSI) to sell it under the name WordPerfect in 1980. A port to {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} followed in 1982 and several greatly updated versions quickly followed.</p>
        <p>The application's feature list was considerably more advanced than contemporary DOS applications like {'WordStar'|link_urls:'i'}, and it rapidly displaced most other systems, especially after the 4.2 release in 1986. By release 5.1 in 1989, WordPerfect had become a standard in the DOS market.</p>
        <p>At the height of its popularity in the 1980s it was a dominant player in the word processor market, but has long since been eclipsed in number of users by Microsoft {'Word'|link_urls:'i'}. While best known in its DOS and {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} versions, its early popularity was based partly on its availability for a wide variety of computers and operating systems.</p>
