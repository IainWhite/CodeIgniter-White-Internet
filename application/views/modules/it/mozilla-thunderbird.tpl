        <p><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird</strong> is a free, open source, cross-platform email, news, and chat client developed by the {'Mozilla Foundation'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>The project strategy was modelled after {'Mozilla Firefox'|link_urls:'w'} , a project aimed at creating a {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>On 7 December 2004, version 1.0 was released, and received more than 500,000 downloads in its first three days of release, and 1,000,000 in 10 days.</p>
        <p>On 6 July 2012, Mozilla announced the company was dropping the priority of Thunderbird development because the continuous effort to extend Thunderbird's feature set was mostly fruitless.</p>
        <p>The new development model is based on Mozilla offering only "Extended Support Releases", which deliver security and maintenance updates, while allowing community to take over the development of new features.</p>
