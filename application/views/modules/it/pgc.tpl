        <p><strong>Professional Graphics Controller</strong> (<strong>PGC</strong>) was a graphics card manufactured by {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'} for the {'PC'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It consisted of three interconnected PCBs, and contained its own processor and memory.</p>
        <p>The PGC's matching display was the IBM 5175, an analogue RGB monitor that is unique to it and not compatible with any other video card without modification.</p>
        <p>With hardware modification, the 5175 can be used with {'VGA'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'}, and various other analogue RGB video sources.</p> 
        <p>Introduced in 1984, the Professional Graphics Controller (often called "Professional Graphics Adapter" and sometimes "Professional Graphics Array") offered a maximum resolution of 640x480 with 256 colours at a refresh rate of 60 Hertz a higher resolution and colour depth than {'EGA'|link_urls:'i'} and {'VGA'|link_urls:'i'} supported. This mode is not BIOS-supported.</p>
        <p>It was intended for the Computer-Aided Design ({'CAD'|link_urls:'i'}) market and included 320k of display RAM and an on-board Intel {'8088'|link_urls:'i'} microprocessor. The 8088 was placed directly on the card to permit rapid updates of video memory. Other cards forced the PC's CPU to write to video memory through a slower ISA bus.</p>
        <p>It was discontinued in 1987 with the arrival of VGA.</p>
