        <p><strong>UNCOL (Universal Computer Oriented Language)</strong> was a proposed universal intermediate language for compilers introduced by {'Melvin Conway'|link_urls:'/p'} in 1958. It was never fully specified or implemented; in many ways it was more a concept than a language.</p>
        <p>UNCOL was intended to make compilers economically available for each new instruction set architecture and programming language. Each machine architecture would require just one compiler back end, and each programming language would require one compiler front end.</p>
        <p>This was a very ambitious goal in 1961 because compiler technology was in its infancy, and little was standardized in computer hardware and software.</p>
