        <p><strong>CorelDraw</strong> is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by {'Corel'|link_urls:'/c'} Corporation of Ottawa, Canada.</p>
        <p>It is also the name of Corel's Graphics Suite, which bundles CorelDraw with a bitmap image editor, Corel Photo-Paint, and other graphics-related programs.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Corel hired software engineers <strong>Michel Bouillon</strong> and <strong>Pat Beirne</strong> to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems.</p>
        <p>That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989.</p>
        <p>CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x runs under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of TrueType in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as Adobe Type Manager; paired with a photo editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.</p>
