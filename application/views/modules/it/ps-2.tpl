        <p>The <strong>Personal System/2</strong> or <strong>PS/2</strong> was IBM's third generation of personal computers released in 1987.</p>
        <p>The PS/2 line was created by {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} in an attempt to recapture control of the {'PC'|link_urls:'i'} market by introducing an advanced yet proprietary architecture.</p>
        <p>IBM's considerable market presence plus the reliability of the PS/2 ensured that the systems would sell in relatively large numbers, especially to large businesses.</p>
        <p>However the other major manufacturers bulked at IBM's licensing terms to develop and sell compatible hardware, particularly as the demanded royalties were on a per machine basis.</p>
        <p>Also the evolving {'Wintel'|link_urls:'/c'} architecture was seeing a period of dramatic reductions in price, and so these developments prevented the PS/2 from returning control of the PC market to IBM. </p>
        <p>Due to the higher costs of the architecture, customers preferred competing PCs that extended the existing PC architecture instead of abandoning it for something new.</p>
        <p>However, many of the PS/2's innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1440K 3.5-inch floppy disk format, 72-pin SIMMs, the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and the {'VGA'|link_urls:'i'} video standard, went on to become standards in the broader PC market.</p>
        <p>The {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'} operating system was announced at the same time as the PS/2 line and was intended to be the primary operating system for models with Intel {'80286'|link_urls:'i'} or later processors. However, at the time of the first shipments, only {'PC DOS'|link_urls:'i'} was available. OS/2 1.0 (text-mode only) and Microsoft's {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} 2.0 became available several months later.</p>
        <p>IBM also released AIX PS/2, a {'UNIX'|link_urls:'i'} operating system for PS/2 models with Intel {'80386'|link_urls:'i'} or later processors.</p>
