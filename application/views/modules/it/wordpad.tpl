        <p><strong>WordPad</strong> is a basic word processor that is included with almost all versions of {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} from {'Windows 95'|link_urls:'i'} onwards.</p>
        <p>It is more advanced than Notepad but simpler than {'Microsoft Works'|link_urls:'i'} Word Processor and {'Microsoft Word'|link_urls:'i'}. It replaced {'Microsoft Write'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>WordPad was introduced in Windows 95, replacing Microsoft Write, which came with all previous versions of Windows (version 3.11 and earlier).</p>
        <p>The source code to WordPad was also distributed by Microsoft as a Microsoft Foundation Classes sample application with MFC 3.2 and later, shortly before the release of Windows 95.</p>
        <p>It is still available for download from the MSDN Web site.</p>
        <p>The default font used in Windows 95 to {'Windows Vista'|link_urls:'i'} was Arial 10, in {'Windows 7'|link_urls:'i'} it was changed to Calibri 11.</p>
        <p>A similar word processor called WordPad is supplied by some vendors on a Windows CE pre-installation.</p>
        <p>It has simple functionality like its desktop OS cousin. The icon resembles an early Microsoft Word icon.</p>
