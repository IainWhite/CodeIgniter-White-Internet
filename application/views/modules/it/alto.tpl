        <p>The <strong>Xerox Alto</strong> was one of the first computers designed for individual use, making it what is now called a personal computer (not to be confused with a home computer).</p>
        <p>However it was expensive and, unlike modern personal computers, not based on a microprocessor.</p>
        <p>It was developed at {'Xerox PARC'|link_urls:'/c'} and released on 1 March 1973.</p>
        <p>It was the first computer to use an early version of the desktop metaphor, first commercialized on the later Xerox Star, and one of the first with a mouse-driven graphical user interface ({'GUI'|link_urls:'i'}) after Douglas Engelbart's <strong>oN-Line System (NLS)</strong> and several other innovations in user interfaces of the time.</p>
        <p>It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, other Xerox facilities, and at several universities for many years.</p>
        <p>The Alto greatly influenced the design of personal computers in the following decades, notably the {'Apple Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} and the first {'Sun'|link_urls:'/c'} workstations.</p>
