        <p><strong>Lotus Word Pro</strong> is word processor software produced by IBM's {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Software group for use on Microsoft Windows-compatible computers and on IBM {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'} Warp.</p>
        <p>Word Pro can be obtained as part of the {'Lotus SmartSuite'|link_urls:'i'} office suite.</p>
        <p>Word Pro was based upon <strong>Ami Pro</strong> (originally published by <strong>Samna</strong>), but was substantially rewritten (including a new native document format).</p>
        <p>The predecessor to Ami Pro, Amí, was released in 1988, and was the first fully functional {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} word processor.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the release of Amí, the development team added support for tables and renamed the product Ami Pro.</p>
        <p>Lotus obtained Ami Pro to round out their office suite by acquiring Samna in 1990.</p>
        <p>Lotus continued to develop Ami Pro further with version 3 released in 1992.</p>
        <p>Version 3.1 is the last version of Ami Pro released (all versions were 16 bit).</p>
        <p>The Windows versions of Ami Pro were also bundled with <strong>Adobe Type Manager for Windows</strong>, as Windows had poor support for scalable fonts before the introduction of TrueType.</p>
