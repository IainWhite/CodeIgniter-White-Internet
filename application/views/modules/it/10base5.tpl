        <p><strong>10BASE5</strong> (also known as <strong>thick ethernet</strong> or <strong>thicknet</strong>) was the original commercially available variant of {'Ethernet'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>For its physical layer it used cable similar to RG-8/U coaxial cable but with extra braided shielding.</p>
        <p>This is a stiff, 0.375 inch (9.5mm) diameter cable with an impedance of 50 ohms, a solid centre conductor, a foam insulating filler, a shielding braid, and an outer jacket.</p>
        <p>The outer sheath was often yellow-to-orange / brown foam fluorinated ethylene propylene (for fire resistance) so it often is called "<em>yellow cable</em>", "<em>orange hose</em>", or sometimes humorously "<em>frozen yellow garden hose</em>".</p>
        <p>10BASE5 has been superseded due to the immense demand for high speed networking, and the low cost of {'Category 5'|link_urls:'i'} cable.</p>
        <p>Both 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 became obsolete after the introduction of Ethernet over twisted pair.</p>
