        <p><strong>Video Graphics Array</strong> (<strong>VGA</strong>) refers specifically to the display hardware first introduced with the IBM {'PS/2'|link_urls:'i'} line of computers in 1987, but through its widespread adoption has also come to mean either an analogue computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector or the 640x480 resolution itself.</p>
        <p>While this resolution was superseded in the personal computer market in the 1990s, mobile devices have only caught up in the last few years.</p>
        <p>VGA was the last graphical standard introduced by {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} that the majority of {'PC'|link_urls:'i'} clone manufacturers conformed to, making it today the lowest common denominator that almost all post-1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement.</p>
        <p>VGA was officially followed by IBM's <strong>Extended Graphics Array</strong> (<strong>XGA</strong>) standard, but it was effectively superseded by numerous slightly different extensions to VGA made by clone manufacturers that came to be known collectively as {'SVGA'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
