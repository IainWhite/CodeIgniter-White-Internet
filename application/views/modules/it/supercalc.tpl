        <p><strong>SuperCalc</strong> was a spreadsheet application published by Sorcim in 1980, and originally bundled (along with {'WordStar'|link_urls:'i'}) as part of the {'CP/M'|link_urls:'i'} software package included with the <strong>Osborne 1</strong> portable computer.</p>
        <p>Versions of SuperCalc were later released for the Apple II family, for PCs running {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, and, after Sorcim was bought by CA Technologies (CA) in the mid-1980s, for {'MS Windows'|link_urls:'i'} (under the name <strong>CA-SuperCalc</strong>).</p>
