        <p><strong>NeXTSTEP</strong> is an object-oriented, multitasking operating system which was developed by {'NeXT'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc to run on its range of proprietary workstation computers, such as the NeXTcube. It was later ported to several other computer architectures.</p>
        <p>NeXTSTEP was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries.</p>
        <p>The result was the <strong>OpenStep API</strong>, which ran on multiple underlying operating systems, including NeXT's own OPENSTEP.</p>
        <p>Apple's {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} and iOS are direct descendants of NeXTSTEP, through the OPENSTEP lineage.</p>
