        <p><strong>Microsoft Write</strong> is a basic word processor included with {'Windows 1'|link_urls:'i'} and later, until {'Windows NT'|link_urls:'i'} 3.5.</p>
        <p>Throughout its lifespan it was minimally updated, and is comparable to early versions of <strong>MacWrite</strong>.</p>
        <p>Early versions of Write only work with Write (<code>.wri</code>) files, but after {'Windows 3'|link_urls:'i'}, Write became capable of reading and composing early {'Word'|link_urls:'i'} (<code>.doc</code>) documents.</p>
        <p>With Windows 3.1, Write became {'OLE'|link_urls:'i'} capable. In {'Windows 95'|link_urls:'i'}, Write was replaced with {'WordPad'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Being a word processor, Write features additional document formatting features that are not found in Notepad (a simple text editor), such as a choice of font, text decorations and paragraph indentation for different parts of the document.</p>
        <p>Unlike WordPad, Write can justify a paragraph.</p>
