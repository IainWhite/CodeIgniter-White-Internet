        <p><strong>iOS</strong> (previously <strong>iPhone OS</strong>) is a mobile operating system developed by {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc. and distributed exclusively for Apple hardware.</p>
        <p>It is the operating system that powers {'iPhone'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iPad'|link_urls:'i'}, iPod Touch, and Apple TV.</p>
        <p>Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone, it has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007), iPad (January 2010), iPad Mini (November 2012) and second-generation Apple TV onward (September 2010).</p>
        <p>The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.</p>
        <p>Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface.</p>
        <p>Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).</p>
        <p>iOS shares with {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} some frameworks such as Core Foundation and Foundation; however, its UI toolkit is {'Cocoa Touch'|link_urls:'i'} rather than OS X's {'Cocoa'|link_urls:'i'}, so that it provides the UIKit framework rather than the AppKit framework.</p>
        <p>It is therefore not compatible with OS X for applications.</p>
        <p>Also while iOS also shares the Darwin foundation with OS X, Unix-like shell access is not available for users and restricted for apps, making iOS not fully Unix-compatible either.</p>
