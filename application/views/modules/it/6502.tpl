        <p>The <strong>MOS Technology 6502</strong> is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch for MOS Technology. When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was, by a considerable margin, the least expensive full-featured microprocessor on the market.</p>
        <p>It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as Motorola and Intel, and caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market.</p>
        <p>It was nevertheless fully comparable with them and, along with the Zilog {'Z80'|link_urls:'i'}, sparked a series of computer projects that would eventually result in the home computer revolution of the 1980s.</p>
        <p>Popular home video game consoles and computers, such as Atari, Apple II, Commodore 64 and others, used the 6502 or variations of the basic design.</p>
        <p>Soon after the 6502's introduction, MOS Technology was purchased outright by Commodore International, who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the 6502, it was second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek, and later licensed to other companies.</p>
