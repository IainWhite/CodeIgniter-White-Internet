        <p><strong>Lotus Freelance Graphics</strong> is an information graphics and presentation program developed by {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Software following its acquisition of Graphic Communications Inc in 1986.</p>
        <p>Lotus Freelance Graphics is a part of the {'Lotus SmartSuite'|link_urls:'i'} office suite for {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It allows users to create and compile text, digital images, diagrams, basic drawings, and charts (such as bar charts and pie charts) into a digital slide show.</p>
        <p>The program was originally an enhancement for the graphing function of the {'Lotus 1-2-3'|link_urls:'i'} spreadsheet-based program.</p>
        <p>Freelance worked within {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} to produce slides that were a worthy competitor to {'PowerPoint'|link_urls:'i'}, a program that was started for the {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} system.</p>
        <p>Lotus opted to develop for {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'} and got left behind on {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} giving {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} a head start.</p>
        <p>{'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} then acquired Lotus, Microsoft then used a licensing issue with IBM to delay Lotus and IBM access to the {'Windows 95'|link_urls:'i'} code base giving {'Office'|link_urls:'i'} a 6 month head start over {'Lotus SmartSuite'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>With the general lack of adoption of {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'}, Freelance became a little-used system.</p>
