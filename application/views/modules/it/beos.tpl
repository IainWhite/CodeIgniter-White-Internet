        <p><strong>BeOS</strong> is an operating system for personal computers first developed by Be Inc. in 1991.</p>
        <p>It was first written to run on <strong>BeBox</strong> hardware.</p>
        <p>BeOS was built for digital media work and was written to take advantage of modern hardware facilities such as symmetric multiprocessing by utilizing modular I/O bandwidth, pervasive multithreading, preemptive multitasking and a 64-bit journaling file system known as BFS.</p>
        <p>The BeOS {'GUI'|link_urls:'i'}  was developed on the principles of clarity and a clean, uncluttered design.</p>
        <p>BeOS was positioned as a multimedia platform which could be used by a substantial population of desktop users and a competitor to {'Mac OS'|link_urls:'i'}  and {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>However, it was ultimately unable to achieve a significant market share and proved commercially unviable for Be Inc.</p>
