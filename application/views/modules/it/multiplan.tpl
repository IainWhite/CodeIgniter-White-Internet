        <p><strong>Multiplan</strong> was an early spreadsheet program developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>Known initially by the code name "<em>EP</em>" (for "<em>Electronic Paper</em>"), it was introduced in 1982 as a competitor for {'VisiCalc'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Multiplan was released first for computers running {'CP/M'|link_urls:'i'}; it was developed using a Microsoft proprietary p-code {'C'|link_urls:'/l'} compiler as part of a portability strategy that facilitated ports to systems such as {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, Xenix, Commodore 64 and 128, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, TRS-80 Model 4, TRS-80 Model 100 (on ROM), Apple II, and Burroughs B-20 series.</p>
        <p>Despite the release of <strong>Microsoft Chart</strong>, a graphics companion program, Multiplan continued to be outsold by {'Lotus 1-2-3'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It was replaced by {'Microsoft Wxcel'|link_urls:'i'} which followed some years later on both the {'Apple Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} (1985) and {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} (1987).</p>
