        <p>The <strong>Object Windows Library</strong> (<strong>OWL</strong>) is a {'Borland C++'|link_urls:'/l'} object-oriented framework originally designed for {'Windows API'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>It was used in {'Turbo Pascal'|link_urls:'/l'} for Windows, Borland Pascal and their Borland C++ package.</p>
        <p>It was a competitor to the <strong>Microsoft Foundation Class Library</strong> ({'MFC'|link_urls:'i'}).</p>
        <p>OWL had incomplete support by the Borland C++ {'IDE'|link_urls:'i'} and wasn't always upwardly compatible from release to release.</p>
        <p>It was eventually deprecated in favor of the <strong>Visual Component Library</strong> ({'VCL'|link_urls:'i'}), which is written in Object Pascal and included in {'Delphi'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'C++Builder'|link_urls:'/l'} Studios.</p>
