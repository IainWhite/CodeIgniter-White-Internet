        <p><strong>Android</strong> is an operating system based on the {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'} kernel with a user interface based on direct manipulation, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.</p>
        <p>The operating system uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard.</p>
        <p>Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in televisions, games consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.</p>
        <p>As of 2011, Android has the largest installed base of any mobile {'O/S'|link_urls:'i'} and as of 2013, its devices also sell more than {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'} and {'Mac OS'|link_urls:'i'} devices combined.</p>
        <p>As of July 2013 the <strong>Google Play</strong> store has had over 1 million Android apps published, and over 50 billion apps downloaded.</p>
        <p>Android's source code is released by {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'} under open source licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software.</p>
        <p>Initially developed by <strong>Android, Inc.</strong>, which Google backed financially and later bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Android is popular with technology companies which require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices.</p>
        <p>Android's open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices which were officially released running other operating systems.</p>
        <p>The operating system's success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called "smartphone wars" between technology companies.</p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>The green Android logo was designed for Google in 2007 by graphic designer <strong>Irina Blok</strong>.</p>
        <p>The design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design.</p>
        <p>After numerous design developments based on science-fiction and space movies, the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape.</p>
        <p>As Android is open-sourced, it was agreed that the logo should be likewise, and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design.</p>
