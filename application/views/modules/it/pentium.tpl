        <p><strong>Pentium</strong> is a brand used for a series of {'x86'|link_urls:'i'}-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel.</p>
        <p>In its most current form, a Pentium processor is a consumer-level product that Intel rates as "two stars", meaning that it is above the low-end Atom and Celeron products but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.</p>
        <p>The name Pentium is originally derived from the Greek word <strong>pente</strong>, meaning "five" (as the original Pentium processors used Intel's fifth-generation micro-architecture, the <strong>P5</strong>), and the Latin ending <strong>-ium</strong>.</p>
