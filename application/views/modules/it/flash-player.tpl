        <p>The <strong>Adobe Flash Player</strong> is freeware software for viewing multimedia, executing rich Internet applications, and streaming video and audio, content created on the Adobe Flash platform.</p>
        <p>Flash Player can run from a {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} (as a browser plug-in) or on supported mobile devices, but there also exist versions running directly on an operating system intended both for regular users and content developers, denoted with the Projector (or Standalone) and Debugger name suffixes, respectively.</p>
        <p>Flash Player runs SWF files that can be created by the Adobe Flash Professional authoring tool, by <strong>Adobe Flex</strong> or by a number of other {'Macromedia'|link_urls:'/c'} and third party tools.</p>
        <p>Flash Player was created by {'Macromedia'|link_urls:'/c'} and now developed and distributed by {'Adobe'|link_urls:'/c'} Systems after its acquisition.</p>
