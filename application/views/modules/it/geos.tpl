        <p><strong>GEOS</strong> is a computer operating environment, graphical user interface, and suite of application software.</p>
        <p>Originally released as <strong>PC/GEOS</strong>, it runs on {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} based, {'IBM PC compatible'|link_urls:'i'} computers.</p>
        <p>The package later became <strong>GeoWorks Ensemble</strong>, then <strong>NewDeal Office</strong>, and is now <strong>Breadbox Ensemble</strong>.</p>
        <p>Versions for some handheld platforms were also released.</p>
        <p>PC/GEOS was first created by <strong>Berkeley Softworks</strong>, who later became <strong>GeoWorks Corporation</strong>. Version 4.0 was developed in 2001 by Breadbox Computer Company, LLC, and named Breadbox Ensemble.</p>
        <p>PC/GEOS should not be confused with the 8-bit GEOS product from the same company, which runs on the Commodore 64 and other computers using MOS {'6502'|link_urls:'i'}-compatible microprocessors.</p>

        <h2>GeoWorks Ensemble</h2>
        <p>In 1990, GeoWorks released GEOS for IBM PC compatible systems, PC/GEOS.</p>
        <p>Also called GeoWorks Ensemble, it was incompatible with the earlier 8-bit versions of GEOS for Commodore and Apple II computers, but provided numerous enhancements, including scalable fonts and multitasking even on {'XT'|link_urls:'i'} and {'AT'|link_urls:'i'} class PC clones.</p>
        <p>GeoWorks saw a market opportunity to provide a graphical user interface for the 16 million older model PCs that were unable to run Microsoft {'Windows 2'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>GEOS was packaged with a suite of productivity applications.</p>
        <p>Each had a name prefixed by "Geo": <strong>GeoWrite</strong>, <strong>GeoDraw</strong>; <strong>GeoManager</strong>; <strong>GeoPlanner</strong>; <strong>GeoDex</strong>, and <strong>GeoComm</strong>.</p>
        <p>It was also bundled with numerous PCs at the time, but like other {'GUI'|link_urls:'i'} environments for the PC platform, such as {'GEM'|link_urls:'i'}, it ultimately proved less successful in the marketplace than {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Former CEO of GeoWorks claims that GEOS faded away because Microsoft threatened to withdraw supply of {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'} to hardware manufacturers who bundled Geoworks with their machines.</p>
        <p>Even though PC/GEOS is referred to as an "operating system", it still requires {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'} software in order to load.</p>
        <p>GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of {'8086'|link_urls:'i'} {'assembly language'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'C'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>

        <h2>PEN/GEOS</h2>
        <p>PEN/GEOS 1.0 was the new name for PC/GEOS 2.0 when GeoWorks released it on 9 April 1992.</p>
        <p>PEN/GEOS 2.0 was released in 1992, and version 3.0 was released in 1995.</p>

        <h3>Nokia Communicator 9000(i) and 9110(i)</h3>
        <p>In 1996, the Nokia 9000 Communicator smartphone was introduced.</p>
        <p>This phone uses PEN/GEOS 3.0 and established the smartphone market.</p>
        <p>Nokia followed with Communicator models 9000i, 9110 and 9110i.</p>
