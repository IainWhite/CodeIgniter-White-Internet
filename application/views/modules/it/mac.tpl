        <p>The <strong>Macintosh</strong>, marketed as <strong>Mac</strong>, is a line of personal computers ({'PC'|link_urls:'i'}s) designed, developed, and marketed by {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc.</p>
        <p>It was initially targeted mainly at the home, education, and creative professional markets. Since the introduction of the Macintosh, the computer has seen significant evolution, now making it one of the most powerful general purpose computers on the market.</p>
        <p>{'Steve Jobs'|link_urls:'/p'} introduced the Macintosh 128K on 24 January 1984.</p>
        <p>This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and mouse. The 128 was followed by numerous updated models also based on the Motorola {'68000'|link_urls:'i'} family processors, producing a family of products in the Macintosh line-up.</p>
        <p>Although the aggressively priced {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} Personal Computer soon overtook Apple in sales, Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer until 1994 when it was overtaken by {'Compaq'|link_urls:'/c'}.
