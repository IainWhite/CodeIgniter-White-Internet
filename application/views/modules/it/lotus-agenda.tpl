        <p><strong>Agenda</strong> is a {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}-based personal information manager, designed by <strong>Mitch Kapor</strong>, <strong>Ed Belove</strong> and <strong>Jerry Kaplan</strong>, and marketed by {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Software.</p>
        <p>Lotus Agenda is a "free-form" information manager: the information need not be structured at all before it is entered into the database. A phrase such as "See Mary on Tuesday 5pm" can be entered as is without any pre-processing.</p>
        <p>Its distinguishing feature was the ability to allow users to input data before the creation of database tables, giving the program flexibility to accommodate the myriad pieces of information a person may need to keep track of.</p>
        <p>The program was an attempt to create a "spreadsheet" for words. The computing industry was at first quite taken by its audacious goal and the power it brought to users as they were given a tool that allowed them to structure "real life" information in any way they wished.</p>
        <p>Its flexibility proved to be its Achilles heel. New users confronted with so much flexibility were often overpowered by the steep learning curve required to use the program.</p>
        <p>Attempts to overcome this through packaging pre-built databases with the program were insufficient to lift sales to adequate levels. In the end only several hundred thousand copies were sold.</p>
        <p>The program reached version 2.0b. Instead of porting Agenda to {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, Lotus stopped development on this program and introduced a new PIM, {'Lotus Organizer'|link_urls:'i'}, that uses the paper-based organizer metaphor, in its place.</p>
