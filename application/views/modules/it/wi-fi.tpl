        <p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, also written as <strong>Wifi</strong> or <strong>WiFi</strong>, is a local area wireless technology that allows an electronic device to exchange data or connect to the {'Internet'|link_urls:'i'} using 2.4 GHz UHF and 5 GHz SHF radio waves.</p>
        <p>The name is a trademark name, and is a play on the audiophile term Hi-Fi.</p>
        <p>The {'Wi-Fi Alliance'|link_urls:'/c'} defines Wi-Fi as any "<em>wireless local area network (<strong>WLAN</strong>) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' ({'IEEE'|link_urls:'/c'}) 802.11 standards</em>".</p>
        <p>However, since most modern WLANs are based on these standards, the term "<em>Wi-Fi</em>" is used in general English as a synonym for "<em>WLAN</em>".</p>
        <p>Only Wi-Fi products that complete Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification testing successfully may use the "<em>Wi-Fi CERTIFIED</em>" trademark.</p>
        <p>Many devices can use Wi-Fi, e.g., personal computers, video-game consoles, smartphones, some digital cameras, tablet computers and digital audio players.</p>
        <p>These can connect to a network resource such as the Internet via a wireless network access point.</p>
        <p>Such an access point (or <em>hotspot</em>) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors.</p>
        <p>Hotspot coverage can comprise an area as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.</p>
        <p>Wi-Fi can be less secure than wired connections (such as {'Ethernet'|link_urls:'i'}) because an intruder does not need a physical connection.</p>
        <p>Web pages that use {'SSL'|link_urls:'w'} are secure but unencrypted Internet access can easily be detected by intruders. Because of this, Wi-Fi has adopted various encryption technologies.</p>
        <p>The early encryption {'WEP'|link_urls:'i'}, proved easy to break. Higher quality protocols ({'WPA'|link_urls:'i'}, WPA2) were added later.</p>
        <p>An optional feature added in 2007, called Wi-Fi Protected Setup ({'WPS'|link_urls:'i'}), had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password.</p>
        <p>The Wi-Fi Alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks.</p>
