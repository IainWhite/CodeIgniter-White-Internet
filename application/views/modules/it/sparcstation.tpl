        <p>The <strong>SPARCstation</strong>, <strong>SPARCserver</strong> and <strong>SPARCcenter</strong> product lines were a series of {'SPARC'|link_urls:'i'}-based computer workstations and servers in desktop, deskside (pedestal) and rack-based form factor developed and sold by {'Sun'|link_urls:'/c'} Microsystems.</p>
        <p>The first SPARCstation was the SPARCstation 1 (also known as the Sun 4/60), introduced in 1989.</p>
        <p>The series was very popular and introduced the Sun-4c architecture, a variant of the Sun-4 architecture previously introduced in the Sun 4/260.</p>
        <p>Thanks in part to the delay in the development of more modern processors from Motorola, the SPARCstation series was very successful across the entire industry.</p>
        <p>The last model bearing the SPARCstation name was the SPARCstation 20.</p>
        <p>The workstation series was replaced by the Sun Ultra series in 1995; the next Sun server generation was the Sun Enterprise line introduced in 1996.</p>
