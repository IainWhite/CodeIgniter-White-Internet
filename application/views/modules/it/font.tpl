        <p>In traditional typography, a <strong>font</strong> is a particular size, weight and style of a {'typeface'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Each font was a matched set of metal type, one piece (called a "sort") for each glyph, and a typeface comprised a range of fonts that shared an overall design.</p>
        <p>In modern usage, with the advent of digital typography, "font" is frequently synonymous with "typeface".</p>
        <p>In particular, the use of "vector" or "outline" fonts means that different sizes of a typeface can be dynamically generated from one design.</p>
