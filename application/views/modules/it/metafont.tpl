        <p><strong>Metafont</strong> is a description language used to define vector fonts.</p>
        <p>It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. {'PostScript'|link_urls:'/l'}. Metafont was devised by {'Donald Knuth'|link_urls:'/p'} as counterpart to his {'TeX'|link_urls:'i'} typesetting system.</p>
        <p>One of the characteristics of Metafont is that all of the shapes of the glyphs are defined with geometrical equations.</p>
        <p>In particular, one can define a given point to be the intersection of a line segment and a B&eacute;zier cubic.</p>
