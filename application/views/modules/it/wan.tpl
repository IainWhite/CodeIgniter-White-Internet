        <p>A <strong>Wide Area Network</strong> (<strong>WAN</strong>) is a network that covers a broad area (i.e., any telecommunications network that links across metropolitan, regional, national or international boundaries) using leased telecommunication lines.</p>
        <p>Business and government entities utilize WANs to relay data among employees, clients, buyers, and suppliers from various geographical locations.</p>
        <p>In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location.</p>
        <p>The {'Internet'|link_urls:'i'} can be considered a WAN as well, and is used by businesses, governments, organizations, and individuals for almost any purpose imaginable.</p>
