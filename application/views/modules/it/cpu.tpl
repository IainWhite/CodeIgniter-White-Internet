        <p>A <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> (<strong>CPU</strong>) is the {'hardware'|link_urls:'i'} within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.</p>
        <p>The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.</p>
        <p>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</p>
        <p>Example: Intel {'8086'|link_urls:'i'}, MOS {'6502'|link_urls:'i'}, Motorola {'68000'|link_urls:'i'} and Zilog {'Z80'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
