        <p><strong>Cocoa Touch</strong> is a UI framework for building software programs to run on the {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'} operating system (for the {'iPhone'|link_urls:'i'}, iPod Touch, and {'iPad'|link_urls:'i'}) from {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} Inc.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch provides an abstraction layer of iOS, the operating system for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch is based on the Mac OS X Cocoa API toolset and, like it, is primarily written in the {'Objective-C'|link_urls:'/l'} language.</p>
        <p>Cocoa Touch allows the use of hardware and features that are not found in Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} computers and are thus unique to the iOS range of devices.</p>
        <p>Just like {'Cocoa'|link_urls:'i'}, Cocoa Touch follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture.</p>
        <p>Tools for developing applications based on Cocoa Touch are included in the iOS SDK.</p>
