        <p><strong>SPARC</strong> (from "<strong>S</strong>calable <strong>P</strong>rocessor <strong>ARC</strong>hitecture") is a {'RISC'|link_urls:'i'} instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by {'Sun'|link_urls:'/c'} Microsystems and introduced in mid 1987.</p>
        <p>SPARC is a registered trademark of SPARC International, Inc., an organization established in 1989 to promote the SPARC architecture, manage SPARC trademarks, and provide conformance testing.</p>
        <p>Implementations of the original 32-bit SPARC architecture were initially designed and used in Sun's Sun-4 workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier Sun-3 systems based on the Motorola {'68000'|link_urls:'i'} family of processors.</p>
        <p>Later, SPARC processors were used in SMP and CC-NUMA servers produced by Sun, Solbourne and Fujitsu, among others, and designed for 64-bit operation.</p>
        <p>SPARC International was intended to open the SPARC architecture to make a larger ecosystem for the design, which has been licensed to several manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, Atmel, Cypress Semiconductor, and Fujitsu.</p>
        <p>As a result of SPARC International, the SPARC architecture is fully open and non-proprietary.</p>
        <p>In March 2006 the complete design of Sun's UltraSPARC T1 microprocessor was released in open-source form at OpenSPARC.net and named the OpenSPARC T1.</p>
        <p>In 2007 the design of Sun's UltraSPARC T2 microprocessor was also released in open-source form as OpenSPARC T2.</p>
