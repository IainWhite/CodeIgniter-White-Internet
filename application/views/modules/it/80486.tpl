        <p>The <strong>Intel 80486</strong> (marketed as <strong>i486</strong>) was a higher performance follow-up to the Intel {'80386'|link_urls:'i'} microprocessor.</p>
        <p>Introduced in 1989, it was the first tightly pipelined {'x86'|link_urls:'i'} design as well as the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors, due to a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit.</p>
        <p>It represents a fourth generation of binary compatible CPUs since the original {'8086'|link_urls:'i'} of 1978.</p>
        <p>The i486 was without the usual 80-prefix because of a court ruling that prohibited trademarking numbers (such as 80486).</p>
        <p>Later, with the introduction of the {'Pentium'|link_urls:'i'} brand, Intel began branding its chips with words rather than numbers.</p>
