        <p><strong>ActiveX</strong> is a software framework created by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} which adapts its earlier {'Component Object Model'|link_urls:'i'} (COM) and Object Linking and Embedding ({'OLE'|link_urls:'i'}) technologies for content downloaded from a network, particularly in the context of the {'World Wide Web'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>It was introduced 1996 and is commonly used in its {'windows'|link_urls:'i'} operating system.</p>
        <p>In principle it is not dependent on Microsoft Windows, but in practice, most ActiveX controls require either Microsoft Windows or a Windows emulator.</p>
        <p>Most also require the client to be running on Intel {'x86'|link_urls:'i'} hardware, because they contain compiled code.</p>
        <p>Many Microsoft Windows applications - including many of those from Microsoft itself, such as {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Microsoft office'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Microsoft Visual Studio'|link_urls:'i'}, and <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> use ActiveX controls to build their feature-set and also encapsulate their own functionality as ActiveX controls which can then be embedded into other applications.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer also allows the embedding of ActiveX controls in web pages. However, ActiveX will not work on all platforms, so using ActiveX controls to implement essential functionality of a web page restricts its usefulness.</p>
