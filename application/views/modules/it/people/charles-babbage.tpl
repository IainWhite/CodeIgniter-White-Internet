        <p><strong>Charles Babbage</strong> (26 December 1791 â€“ 18 October 1871) was an English polymath.</p>
        <p>He was a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, who is best remembered now for originating the concept of a programmable computer.</p>
        <p>Considered a "<em>father of the computer</em>", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs.</p>
        <p>Parts of Babbage's uncompleted mechanisms are on display in the London Science Museum. In 1991, a perfectly functioning {'difference engine'|link_urls:'i'} was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.</p>
