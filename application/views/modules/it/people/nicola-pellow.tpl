        <p><strong>Nicola Pellow</strong> was a member of the <strong>World Wide Web Project</strong> at {'CERN'|link_urls:'/c'}, working with {'Tim Berners-Lee'|link_urls:'/p'}.</p>
        <p>She joined the project in November 1990, while an undergraduate math student at Leicester Polytechnic.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the <strong>WorldWideWeb</strong> web browser for the {'NeXT'|link_urls:'i'} platform, Pellow wrote a generic Line Mode Browser called <strong>WWW</strong> that could run on non-NeXT systems.</p>
        <p>The WWW team ported the browser to a range of computers, from {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} to Microsoft {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, so that anyone could access the web, which at that point consisted primarily of the CERN phone book.</p>
        <p>She left CERN at the end of August 1991, but returned after graduating in 1992, and worked with {'Robert Cailliau'|link_urls:'/p'} on <strong>MacWWW</strong>, the first web browser for Mac OS.</p>
