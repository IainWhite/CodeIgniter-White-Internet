        <p><strong>Robert Cailliau</strong> (born 26 January 1947) is a Belgian informatics engineer and computer scientist who, together with {'Tim Berners-Lee'|link_urls:'/p'}, developed the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>.</p>
        <p>Cailliau was born in Tongeren, Belgium. In 1958 he moved with his parents to Antwerp. After secondary school he graduated from Ghent University in 1969 as civil engineer in electrical and mechanical engineering.</p>
        <p>During his military service in the Belgian Army he maintained {'Fortran'|link_urls:'/l'} programs to simulate troop movements.</p>
        <p>In December 1974 he started working at {'CERN'|link_urls:'/c'} as a Fellow in the Proton Synchrotron division, working on the control system of the accelerator.</p>
        <p>In April 1987 he left the PS division to become group leader of Office Computing Systems in the Data Handling division.</p>
        <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a hypertext system for access to the many forms of documentation at and related to CERN.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee created the system, calling it World Wide Web, between September to December 1990. During this time, Cailliau and he co-authored a proposal for funding for the project.</p>
        <p>Cailliau later became a key proponent of the project and developed with {'Nicola Pellow'|link_urls:'/p'} the first web browser for the Mac OS operating system called <strong>MacWWW</strong>.</p>
        <p>In 1993, in collaboration with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Cailliau started the European Commission's first web-based project for information dissemination in Europe (WISE).</p>
        <p>As a result of his work with CERN's Legal Service, CERN released the web technology into the public domain on 30 April 1993.</p>
