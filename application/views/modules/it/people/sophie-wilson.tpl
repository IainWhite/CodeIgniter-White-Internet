        <p><strong>Sophie Wilson</strong> (born Roger Wilson in Leeds, England, in 1957) is a British computer scientist.</p>
        <p>In 1978, she designed the {'Acorn'|link_urls:'/c'} Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by Acorn Computers Ltd.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Wilson extended the Acorn Atom's {'BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language dialect into an improved version for the <strong>Acorn Proton</strong>, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project, whereupon the Proton became the {'BBC Micro'|link_urls:'i'} and its BASIC was developed into {'BBC BASIC'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>In 1983, she designed the instruction set for one of the first {'RISC'|link_urls:'i'} processors, the <strong>Acorn RISC Machine</strong> ({'ARM'|link_urls:'i'}), later to become one of the most successful IP cores (i.e., a licenced CPU core) of the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
        <p>Wilson designed <strong>Acorn Replay</strong>, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included the operating system extensions for video access as well as the codecs themselves, optimised to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards.</p>
        <p>Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about her time there.</p>
        <p>Wilson is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcomâ€™s Cambridge, U.K. office. She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000.</p>
        <p>She was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article entitled The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History.</p>
        <p>She was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012.</p>
        <p>In 2013 Sophie was elected as a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society.</p>
