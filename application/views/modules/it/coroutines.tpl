        <p><strong>Coroutines</strong> are computer program components that generalize subroutines to allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations.</p>
        <p>Coroutines are well-suited for implementing more familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loop, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.</p>
        <p>The term coroutine was coined by {'Melvin Conway'|link_urls:'/p'} in a 1963 paper.</p>
