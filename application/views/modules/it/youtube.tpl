        <p><strong>YouTube</strong> is a video-sharing website, created by three former {'PayPal'|link_urls:'w'} employees in February 2005 and owned by {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'}  since late 2006, on which users can upload, view and share videos.</p>
        <p>The company is based in San Bruno, California, and uses Adobe {'Flash'|link_urls:'i'} Video and {'HTML5'|link_urls:'w'} technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video content, including video clips, TV clips, and music videos, and amateur content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.</p>
        <p>Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, Hulu, and other organizations offer some of their material via YouTube, as part of the YouTube partnership program.</p>
        <p>Unregistered users can watch videos, and registered users can upload an unlimited number of videos.</p>
