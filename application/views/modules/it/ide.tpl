        <p>An <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.</p>
        <p>An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.</p>
        <p>Most modern IDEs offer Intelligent code completion features.</p>
        <p>Some IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, or both, such as {'NetBeans'|link_urls:'i'} and {'Eclipse'|link_urls:'i'}; others do not, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus.</p>
        <p>The boundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a {'version control'|link_urls:'i'} system and various tools are integrated to simplify the construction of a {'GUI'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use in object-oriented software development.</p>
