        <p><strong>Eclipse</strong> is an Integrated Development Environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}).</p>
        <p>It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.</p>
        <p>Written mostly in {'Java'|link_urls:'/l'}, Eclipse can be used to develop applications.</p>
        <p>By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: {'Ada'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'C'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'C++'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'COBOL'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Fortran'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Haskell'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Perl'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'PHP'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Prolog'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Python'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'R'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Ruby'|link_urls:'/l'} (including Ruby on Rails framework), {'Scala'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Clojure'|link_urls:'/l'}, {'Groovy'|link_urls:'/l'} and {'Erlang'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.</p>
        <p>The initial codebase originated from {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'} <strong>VisualAge</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Eclipse software development kit (SDK), which includes the Java development tools, is meant for Java developers.</p>
        <p>Users can extend its abilities by installing plug-ins written for the Eclipse Platform, such as development toolkits for other programming languages, and can write and contribute their own plug-in modules.</p>
