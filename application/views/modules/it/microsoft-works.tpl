        <p><strong>Microsoft Works</strong> is a discontinued office suite by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>Works is smaller, was less expensive, and has fewer features than {'Microsoft office'|link_urls:'i'} or other major office suites.</p>
        <p>Its core functionality includes a word processor, a spreadsheet and a database management system.</p>
        <p>Later versions have a calendar application and a dictionary while older releases included a terminal emulator.</p>
        <p>Works was available as a standalone program, and as part of a namesake home productivity suite.</p>
        <p>Because of its low cost companies frequently pre-installed Works on their consumer-grade machines.</p>
