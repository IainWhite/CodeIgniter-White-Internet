        <p><strong>Scrum</strong> is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing software projects and product or application development.</p>
        <p>Its focus is on "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal" as opposed to a "traditional, sequential approach".</p>
        <p>Scrum enables the creation of self-organizing teams by encouraging co-location of all team members, and verbal communication between all team members and disciplines in the project.</p>
        <p>A key principle of Scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements churn), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner.</p>
        <p>As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approachâ€”accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p>

        <p>{'Jeff Sutherland'|link_urls:'/p'} and {'Ken Schwaber'|link_urls:'/p'}created Scrum as a formal software development process at OOPSLA'95.</p>
