        <p><strong>Hofstadter's Law</strong> is a self-referential time-related adage, coined by <strong>Douglas Hofstadter</strong> and named after him.</p>
        <p>Hofstadter's Law:<br />
        <em>"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."</em> - Douglas Hofstadter
        </p>
        <p>Hofstadter's Law was a part of Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book <strong>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>.</p>
        <p>The law is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity.</p>
        <p>It is often cited amongst programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as{'The Mythical Man-Month'|link_urls:'/b'} or {'Extreme Programming'|link_urls:'m'}.</p>
        <p>The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.</p>
        <p>The law was initially introduced in connection with a discussion of chess-playing computers, where top-level players were continuously beating machines, even though the machines outweighed the players in recursive analysis.</p>
        <p>The intuition was that the players were able to focus on particular positions instead of following every possible line of play to its conclusion.</p>
        <p>Hofstadter wrote: <em>"In the early days of computer chess, people used to estimate that it would be ten years until a computer (or program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than ten years away"</em>.
