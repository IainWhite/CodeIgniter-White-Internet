        <p><strong>Drush</strong> is a computer software shell-based application used to control, manipulate, and administer {'Drupal'|link_urls:'w'} websites.</p>
        <p>On the surface, Drush is a tool for updating site modules, however Drush has a more comprehensive list of features.</p>
        <p>Drush was originally developed by <strong>Arto</strong> for Drupal 4.7. In May 2007, it was partly rewritten and redesigned for Drupal 5 by Frando. Drush is maintained by Moshe Weitzman, Owen Barton, greg.1.anderson, and jonhattan.</p>
        <p>Drush is a command line shell and {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} scripting interface for Drupal. Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like modules / themes / profiles. Similarly, it runs <code>update.php</code>, executes {'SQL'|link_urls:'w'} queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache.</p>
