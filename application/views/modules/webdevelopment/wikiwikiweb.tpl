        <p>The <strong>WikiWikiWeb</strong> is the first ever {'wiki'|link_urls:'w'}, or user-editable website.</p>
        <p>It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer {'Ward Cunningham'|link_urls:'/p'}, to accompany the <strong>Portland Pattern Repository</strong> website discussing software design patterns.</p>
        <p>The name WikiWikiWeb originally also applied to the wiki software, written in the {'Perl'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language, that operated the website, which was subsequently renamed to "<strong>WikiBase</strong>".</p>
        <p>The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply "Wiki", and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized W referred exclusively to the original site.</p>
