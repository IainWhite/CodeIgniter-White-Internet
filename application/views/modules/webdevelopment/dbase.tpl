        <p><strong>dBase</strong> (also stylised <strong>dBASE</strong>) was one of the first and in its day the most successful database management systems for microcomputers.</p>
        <p>The dBase system includes the core database engine, a query system, a forms engine, and a programming language that ties all of these components together.</p>
        <p>dBase's underlying file format, the .dbf file, is widely used in applications needing a simple format to store structured data.</p>
        <p>dBase was originally published by <strong>Ashton-Tate</strong> for microcomputer operating system {'CP/M'|link_urls:'i'} in 1980, and later ported to Apple II and {'IBM PC'|link_urls:'i'} computers running {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>On the PC platform, in particular, dBase became one of the best-selling software titles for a number of years.</p>
        <p>A major upgrade was released as dBase III, and ported to a wider variety of platforms, adding {'UNIX'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'VMS'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1980s, Ashton-Tate was one of the "<em>big three</em>" software publishers in the early business software market, the others being {'Lotus'|link_urls:'/c'} Development and WordPerfect.</p>
        <p>Starting in the mid-1980s, several companies produced their own variations on the dBase product and especially the dBase programming language.</p>
        <p>These included <strong>FoxBASE+</strong> (later renamed {'FoxPro'|link_urls:'w'}), <strong>Clipper</strong>, and other so-called xBase products.</p>
        <p>Many of these were technically stronger than dBase, but could not push it aside in the market. This changed with the disastrous introduction of dBase IV, whose design and stability were so poor many users switched to other products.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there was growing use of {'SQL'|link_urls:'w'} (<strong>Structured Query Language</strong>) in database products.</p>
        <p>Another factor was user adoption of {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} on desktop computers.</p>
