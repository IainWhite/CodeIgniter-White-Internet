        <p><strong>CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</strong>, is an archive of over 129,703 modules of software in 29,092 distributions, written by 11,274 authors, written in the {'Perl'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language, as well as documentation for them.</p>
        <p>It has a presence on the World Wide Web at {'metacpan.org'|link_urls:'x':'http://metacpan.org'} or via the old interface {'www.cpan.org'|link_urls:'x':'http://www.cpan.org'} and is mirrored worldwide at more than 260 locations.</p>
        <p>CPAN can denote either the archive network itself, or the Perl program that acts as an interface to the network and as an automated software installer (somewhat like a package manager).</p>
        <p>Most software on CPAN is free and open source software. CPAN was conceived in 1993, and the first web-accessible mirror was launched in January 1997.</p>
