        <p><strong>Make</strong> is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.</p>
        <p>Although integrated development environments ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Besides building programs, Make can be used to manage any project where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>
        <p>Make was originally created by Stuart Feldman in April 1976 at {'Bell Labs'|link_urls:'/c'}. In 2003 Dr. Feldman received the ACM Software System Award for the authoring of this widespread tool.</p>
