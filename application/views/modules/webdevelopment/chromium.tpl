        <p><strong>Chromium</strong> is the open source {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} project from which {'Google Chrome'|link_urls:'w'} draws its source code.</p>
        <p>The browsers share the majority of code and features, though there are some minor differences in features and they have different licensing.</p>
        <p>The Chromium Project takes its name from the element chromium, the metal from which chrome plating is made.</p>
        <p>Google's intention, as expressed in the developer documentation, was that Chromium would be the name of the open source project and that the final product name would be Chrome; however other developers have taken the Chromium code and released versions under the Chromium name.</p>
        <p>One of the major aims of the project is for Chrome to be a tabbed window manager, or shell for the web, as opposed to it being a traditional browser application.</p>
        <p>The application is designed to have a minimalist user interface.</p>
        <p>The developers state that it "<em>should feel lightweight (cognitively and physically) and fast</em>".</p>
