        <p><strong>Active Desktop</strong> was a feature of Microsoft {'Internet Explorer 4'|link_urls:'w'}'s optional Windows Desktop Update that allows the user to add {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'} content to the desktop, along with some other features.</p>
        <p>This function was intended to be installed on the then current {'Windows 95'|link_urls:'i'} operating system.</p>
        <p>It was also included in {'Windows 98'|link_urls:'i'} and later Windows operating systems until {'Windows Vista'|link_urls:'i'}, where the feature was discontinued. This corresponded to version Internet Explorer 4.0 to 6.x, but not {'Internet Explorer 7'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>Users can add HTML both in place of the regular wallpaper and as independent re-sizable desktop items.</p>
        <p>Items available on-line can be regularly updated and synchronized so users can stay updated without visiting the website in their browser.</p>
        <p>Active Desktop works much like desktop widget technology in that it allows users to place customized information on their desktop.</p>
