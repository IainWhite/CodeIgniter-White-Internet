        <p>A <strong>Relational Database Management System</strong> (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) is a <strong>database management system</strong> ({'DBMS'|link_urls:'w'}) that is based on the {'relational model'|link_urls:'i'} as introduced by {'E F Codd'|link_urls:'/p'}, of {'IBM'|link_urls:'/c'}'s San Jose Research Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Many popular databases currently in use are based on the relational database model.</p>
        <p>RDBMSs have become a predominant choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and much more since the 1980s.</p>
        <p>Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use.</p>
        <p>The three leading open source implementations are {'MySQL'|link_urls:'w'}, {'PostgreSQL'|link_urls:'w'}, and {'SQLite'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
