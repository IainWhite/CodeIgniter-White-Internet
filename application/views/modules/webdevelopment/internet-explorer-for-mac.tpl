        <p>Internet Explorer for Mac</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Internet Explorer for Macintosh</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition</strong>, <strong>Internet Explorer:mac</strong> or <strong>IE:mac</strong>) was a proprietary {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} for the {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'} platform.</p>
        <p>Initial versions were developed from the same code base as Internet Explorer for Windows. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of version 5 which included the {'Tasman'|link_urls:'w'} {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>As a result of the five-year agreement between {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} and {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} in 1997, it was the default browser on {'Mac OS'|link_urls:'i'} and {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} from 1998 until it was replaced by Apple's own {'Safari'|link_urls:'w'} web browser in 2003 with the release of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.</p>
        <p>On June 13, 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was released on 11 July 2003.</p>
        <p>The browser was not included in the default installation of Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger" which was released on 29 April 2005.</p>
        <p>Microsoft discontinued support for the product on 31 December 2005 and removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site on 31 January 2006.</p>
        <p>Microsoft recommended "<em>that users migrate to more recent web browsing technologies such as Apple's Safari</em>".</p>
