        <p><strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>) is a proprietary protocol developed by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.</p>
        <p>The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.</p>
        <p>Clients exist for most versions of {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} (including Windows Mobile), {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'}, {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}, and other modern operating systems.</p>
        <p>RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for Unix and OS X also exists.</p>
        <p>By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.</p>
        <p>Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP server software as <strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>, formerly "<strong>Terminal Services Client</strong>".</p>
