        <p><strong>Visual FoxPro</strong> is a data-centric object-oriented procedural programming language produced by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>It is derived from {'FoxPro'|link_urls:'w'} (originally known as <strong>FoxBASE</strong>) which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984.</p>
        <p>Fox Technologies merged with Microsoft in 1992, after which the software acquired further features and the prefix "Visual".</p>
        <p>The last version of FoxPro (2.6) worked under Mac OS, {'DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Visual FoxPro 3.0, the first "Visual" version, reduced platform support to only Mac and Windows, and later versions were Windows-only.</p>
