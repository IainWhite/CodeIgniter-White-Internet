        <p>From 1992 through 1996, <strong>Gopher</strong> was an {'Internet'|link_urls:'i'} application in which hierarchically-organized text files could be brought from servers all over the world to a viewer on your computer.</p>
        <p>Especially in universities, Gopher was a step toward the {'World Wide Web'|link_urls:'w'}'s Hypertext Transfer Protocol ({'HTTP'|link_urls:'w'}), which effectively replaced it within a short time.</p>
        <p>With hypertext links, the Hypertext Markup Language ({'HTML'|link_urls:'w'}), and the arrival of a graphical browser, {'Mosaic'|link_urls:'w'}, the Web quickly transcended Gopher.</p>
        <p>Gopher was developed at the University of Minnesota, whose sports teams are called "the Golden Gophers".</p>
        <p>Although most Gopher browsers and files are text-based, Gopher browsers, notably HyperGopher, were developed that displayed graphic images (GIF and JPEG files) that were included in Gopher file directories.</p>
        <p>Two tools for searching Gopher file hierarchies were Veronica and Jughead.</p>
