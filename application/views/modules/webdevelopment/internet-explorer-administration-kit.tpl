        <p><strong>Internet Explorer Administration Kit</strong> (<strong>IEAK</strong>), is a stand-alone freeware computer program from {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} that allows software developers, ISPs, content providers and large organizations to build, deploy and manage customized {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'} installation packages for either distribution or internal use.</p>
        <p>The first IEAK was released for {'Internet Explorer 3'|link_urls:'w'}. Since then, there has been a corresponding IEAK for every Internet Explorer release.</p>
        <p>IEAK can be used by organizations to customize the settings for the browser, integrate add-ons, change branding of the browser to use customized logos, and centrally manage the distribution of the software.</p>
        <p>The IEAK consists of several components, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Explorer Customization Wizard, which lets an organization customize the configuration of the browser, and create redistributable packages with the customizations applied.</li>
            <li>IEAK Profile Manager, which lets create multiple sets of IE settings and customizations. Any of the set can then be quickly selected for building the redistributable.</li>
            <li>IEAK Toolkit, which provides tools, sample scripts and resources such as bitmaps.</li>
        </ul>
