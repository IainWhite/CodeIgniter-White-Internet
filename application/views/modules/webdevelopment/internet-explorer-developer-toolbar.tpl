        <p><strong>Internet Explorer Developer Tools</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar</strong>), is a component of {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'} that aids in design and debugging of web pages.</p>
        <p>It was introduced as a toolbar for Internet Explorer 6 and 7. {'Internet Explorer 8'|link_urls:'w'} and above have developer tools built in.</p>
        <p>It allows validating of {'CSS'|link_urls:'w'} and {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'}, previewing page layout at various resolutions, and also offers a ruler (measuring in pixels) to aid in positioning the elements.</p>
        <p>It allows viewing the source of the entire page, color-coded for ease of navigation, or selected elements of it, as well as view the {'DOM'|link_urls:'w'} source and the CSS selectors that are applied to the element.</p>
        <p>It also enables viewing the properties and styles of individual elements and also trace styles of elements to its declaration.</p>
        <p>The toolbar includes a toggleable pane at the bottom of the window. The pane shows the structure of the web page; and for each structure, the properties and styles.</p>
        <p>It exposes its features through a menu hierarchy, and also includes toolbar buttons for quick access to features like clearing the browser cache and enabling the selecting of elements by clicking in the rendered page, rather than navigating through the visual representation of the DOM tree.</p>
