        <p><strong>WebKit</strong> is a {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'} software component for rendering web pages in {'web browsers'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>It powers {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'}'s {'Safari'|link_urls:'w'} web browser and was previously used in {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'}'s {'Chrome'|link_urls:'w'} web browser.</p>
        <p>WebKit is also used as the basis for the experimental browser included with the <strong>Amazon Kindle</strong> e-book reader, as well as the default browser in the Apple {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}, BlackBerry 10, and Tizen mobile operating systems.</p>
        <p>WebKit's {'C++'|link_urls:'/l'} application programming interface provides a set of classes to display web content in windows, and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user, managing a back-forward list, and managing a history of pages recently visited.</p>
        <p>WebKit's {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'} and {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} code originally began as a fork of the {'KHTML'|link_urls:'w'} and {'KJS'|link_urls:'w'} libraries from {'KDE'|link_urls:'/c'}, and has now been further developed by individuals from KDE, Apple, Google, Nokia, Bitstream, BlackBerry, Igalia, and others.</p>
        <p>{'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'}, and some other {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} like operating systems are supported by the project.</p>
        <p>On 3 April 2013 Google announced that it had forked <strong>WebCore</strong>, a component of WebKit to be used in future versions of Google Chrome and Opera under the name {'Blink'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>WebKit is available under a BSD-form license with the exception of the <strong>WebCore</strong> and <strong>JavaScriptCore</strong> components, which are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
        <p>As of 7 March 2013, WebKit is a trademark of Apple, registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
        <p>The WebKit project was started within Apple by <strong>Don Melton</strong> on 25 June 2001 as a fork of {'KHTML'|link_urls:'w'} and {'KJS'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>KHTML and KJS were ported to OS X with the help of an adapter library and renamed WebCore and {'JavaScriptCore'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
