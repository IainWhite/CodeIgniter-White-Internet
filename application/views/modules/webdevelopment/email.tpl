        <p><strong>Electronic mail</strong>, most commonly referred to as <strong>email</strong> or <strong>e-mail</strong> is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients.</p>
        <p>Modern email operates across the {'Internet'|link_urls:'i'} or other computer networks.</p>
        <p>Email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be on-line simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to a mail server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.
        <p>Historically, the term electronic mail was used generically for any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe fax document transmission.</p>
        <p>An Internet email message consists of three components, the message envelope, the message header, and the message body.</p>
        <p>The message header contains control information, including, minimally, an originator's email address and one or more recipient addresses.</p>
        <p>Usually descriptive information is also added, such as a subject header field and a message submission date/time stamp.</p>
        <p>Originally a text-only ({'ASCII'|link_urls:'i'}) communications medium, Internet email was extended to carry, text in other character sets, multi-media content attachments, a process standardized in {'2045'|link_urls:'rfc'} through 2049. Collectively, these RFCs have come to be called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ({'MIME'|link_urls:'w'}).</p>
        <p>Electronic mail pre-dates the inception of the Internet and was in fact a crucial tool in creating it, but the history of modern, global Internet email services reaches back to the early {'ARPANET'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>Standards for encoding email messages were proposed as early as 1973 ({'561'|link_urls:'rfc'}).</p>
        <p>Conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services. An email sent in the early 1970s looks quite similar to a basic text message sent on the Internet today.</p>
        <p>Network-based email was initially exchanged on the ARPANET in extensions to the File Transfer Protocol ({'FTP'|link_urls:'w'}), but is now carried by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ({'SMTP'|link_urls:'w'}), first published as Internet standard 10 ({'821'|link_urls:'rfc'}) in 1982.</p>
        <p>In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters using a message envelope separate from the message (header and body) itself.</p>
