        <p><strong>The Zend Engine</strong> is the open source scripting engine that interprets the {'PHP'|link_urls:'/l'} programming language.</p>
        <p>It was originally developed by <strong>Andi Gutmans</strong> and <strong>Zeev Suraski</strong> while they were students at the <strong>Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</strong>.</p>
        <p>They later founded a company called {'Zend Technologies'|link_urls:'/c'} in Ramat Gan, Israel. The name <strong>Zend</strong> is a combination of their forenames, <strong>Ze</strong>ev and A<strong>nd</strong>i.</p>
        <p>The first version of the Zend Engine appeared in 1999 in PHP version 4. It was written in {'C'|link_urls:'/l'} as a highly optimized modular back-end, which for the first time could be used in applications outside of PHP. The Zend Engine provides memory and resource management, and other standard services for the PHP language. Its performance, reliability and extensibility played a significant role in PHP's increasing popularity.</p>
        <p>The current version is The <strong>Zend Engine II</strong> at the heart of PHP 5. A new version which significantly improves performance, originally codenamed <strong><em>phpng</em></strong> but now also known as The Zend Engine III, is in development for PHP 7.</p>
        <p>The source code for the Zend Engine has been freely available under the Zend Engine License (although some parts are under the PHP License) since 2001, as part of the official releases from php.net, as well as the official git repository or the GitHub mirror.</p>
