        <p><strong>Zend Studio</strong> is a commercial, proprietary integrated development environment ({'IDE'|link_urls:'i'}) for {'PHP'|link_urls:'/l'} developed by {'Zend Technologies'|link_urls:'/c'}, based on the <strong>PHP Development Tools (PDT)</strong> plugin for the {'Eclipse'|link_urls:'i'} platform (the PDT project is led by Zend).</p>
        <p>Zend Studio is tightly integrated with {'Zend Server'|link_urls:'w'}, Zend's pre-integrated, tested PHP application stack. The integration enables developers to quickly set up a complete PHP environment and speed up root cause analysis of problems detected in testing or in the production environment.</p>
        <p>Zend Studio is also integrated with {'Zend Framework'|link_urls:'w'}. For example, it provides an MVC view for easy code navigation and integration with Zend_Tool for automated code generation.<p>
