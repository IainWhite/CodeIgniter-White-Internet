        <p><strong>MySQL</strong> is (as of July 2013) the world's second most widely used open-source relational database management system ({'RDBMS'|link_urls:'w'}).</p>
        <p>It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The {'SQL'|link_urls:'w'} phrase stands for <strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>uery <strong>L</strong>anguage.</p>
        <p>The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.</p>
        <p>MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used {'LAMP'|link_urls:'w'} open source web application software stack (and other 'AMP' stacks). <strong>LAMP</strong> is an acronym for "{'Linux'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Apache'|link_urls:'w'}, MySQL, {'PHP'|link_urls:'/l'}."</p>
        <p>Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL.</p>
