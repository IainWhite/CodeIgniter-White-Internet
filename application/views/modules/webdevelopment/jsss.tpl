        <p><strong>JavaScript Style Sheets</strong> (<strong>JSSS</strong>) was a stylesheet language technology proposed by {'Netscape'|link_urls:'/c'} Communications Corporation in 1996 to provide facilities for defining the presentation of web pages.</p>
        <p>It was an alternative to the <strong>Cascading Style Sheets ({'CSS'|link_urls:'w'})</strong> technology.</p>
        <p>Although Netscape submitted it to the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium ({'W3C'|link_urls:'/c'})</strong>, the technology was never accepted as a formal standard and it never gained much acceptance in the market.</p>
        <p>Only <strong>{'Netscape Communicatpr'|link_urls:'w'} 4</strong> supported JSSS, with the rival {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'} web browser choosing not to implement the technology.</p>
        <p>Soon after Netscape Communicator's release in 1997, Netscape stopped promoting JSSS, instead focusing on the rival CSS standard, which was also supported by Internet Explorer and had much wider industry acceptance.</p>
        <p>The follow-up to Netscape Communicator, Netscape 6 (released in 2000), dropped support for JSSS. It now remains little more than a historical footnote, with many Web developers not even being aware of its existence.</p>
        <p>The proposed standard was not finished.</p>
