        <p><strong>FoxPro</strong> is a text-based procedurally oriented programming language and DBMS, originally published by Fox Software and later by {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'}], for {'MS-DOS'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'}, and {'UNIX'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>The final published release of FoxPro was 2.6.</p>
        <p>Development has continued under the {'Visual FoxPro'|link_urls:'w'} label, which in turn was discontinued in 2007.</p>
        <p>Although FoxPro is a Database Management System (DBMS) and it does support relationships between tables, it is not considered a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), lacking transactional processing.</p>
