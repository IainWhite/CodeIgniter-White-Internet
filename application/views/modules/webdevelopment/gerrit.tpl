        <p><strong>Gerrit</strong> is a free, web-based team software code review tool.</p>
        <p>Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or reject those changes.</p>
        <p>It integrates closely with {'Git'|link_urls:'w'}, a distributed version control system.</p>
        <p>Gerrit is a fork of {'Rietveld'|link_urls:'w'}, another code review tool.</p>
        <p>"Gerrit" is the given name of <strong>Gerrit Rietveld</strong> (1888 â€“ 1964), a Dutch designer after whom <strong>Rietveld</strong> is named.</p>
        <p>It was developed at {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'} by <strong>Shawn Pearce</strong> for the development of the {'Android'|link_urls:'i'} project.</p>
        <p>Starting from a set of patches for Rietveld, it became a fork and evolved into a separate project when ACL patches wouldn't be merged into Rietveld by its author, <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>.</p>
        <p>Gerrit was originally written in {'Python'|link_urls:'/l'} like Rietveld, but it is now written in {'Java'|link_urls:'/l'}. Gerrit uses {'Google Web Toolkit'|link_urls:'w'} to generate front-end {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} code from Java source.</p>
