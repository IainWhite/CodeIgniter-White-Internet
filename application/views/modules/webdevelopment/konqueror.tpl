        <p><strong>Konqueror</strong> is a free and open-source {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} and file manager that provides file viewer functionality for file systems such as local files, files on a remote {'FTP'|link_urls:'w'} server and files in a disk image.</p>
        <p>It is a core part of the {'KDE'|link_urls:'/c'} Software Compilation.</p>
        <p>Konqueror is developed by volunteers and can run on most {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} like operating systems and on {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'} systems.</p>
        <p>Konqueror is licensed and distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>
        <p>The name "<strong><em>Konqueror</em></strong>" is a reference to the two primary competitors at the time of the browser's first release: "<em>first comes the Navigator, then Explorer, and then the Konqueror</em>".</p>
        <p>It also follows the KDE naming convention: the names of most KDE programs begin with the letter <em>K</em>.</p>
        <p>Konqueror was released with version 2 of KDE on 23 October 2000. It replaces its predecessor, <strong>KFM</strong> (KDE file manager).</p>
        <p>With the release of KDE4, Konqueror was replaced as the default file manager by Dolphin.</p>
