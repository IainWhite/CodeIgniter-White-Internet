        <p><strong>AOL Explorer</strong>, previously known as <strong>AOL Browser</strong>, is a graphical web {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} on the {'Microsoft'|link_urls:'/c'} {'Trident'|link_urls:'w'} {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'} and was released by {'AOL'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>In July 2005, AOL launched AOL Explorer as a free download and as an optional download with {'AIM'|link_urls:'w'} version 5.9.</p>
        <p>On November 2005, the next version, 1.1, was released. Version 1.2 was very similar to version 1.1, but included two new features: Tab Explorer and RSS Widgets from Favourites.</p>
        <p>When the Tab Explorer button is pressed, a thumbnail preview of each tab is displayed in a full-screen window.</p>
        <p>The user can click on one of the previews to instantly access the page.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has implemented a similar feature in their {'Internet Explorer 7'|link_urls:'w'} browser, called "Quick Tabs".</p>
        <p>Version 1.5 was launched in May 2006, and included many new features such as Desktop Widgets, Visual Themes, a Feeds Screensaver and various performance improvements.</p>
        <p>Desktop Widgets allow the user to "tear off" a side panel and use it independently from the browser.</p>
        <p>The panel will remain open and functional, even after one closes AOL Explorer.</p>
        <p>When ones computer is idle, one can set the AOL Explorer Feeds Screensaver to display the RSS feeds stored in the feeds panel.</p>
        <p>Another feature new to 1.5 is the Show Page Preview feature, which allows the user to preview a webpage without leaving the current page by simply holding down <code>Ctrl</code> and right-clicking on a link.</p>
        <p>This feature is especially useful when there are a large amount of links on a page, or when searching.</p>
        <p>In 2003, AOL signed a seven-year contract with Microsoft to use the Trident layout engine in their products and as such AOL Explorer uses this engine.</p>
        <p>Because of this, users can use AOL Explorer to download and install updates from Microsoft Update.</p>
        <p>However, unlike {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'}, AOL does not use {'Bing'|link_urls:'w'} as the default search engine.</p>
        <p>AOL is also the owner of {'Netscape'|link_urls:'/c'} Communications Corporation which had previously published the now defunct {'Netscape'|link_urls:'w'} series of browsers.</p>
