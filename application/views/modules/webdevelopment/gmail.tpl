        <p><strong>Gmail</strong> is a free, advertising-supported {'email'|link_urls:'w'} service provided by {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>Users may access Gmail as secure webmail, as well as via {'POP3'|link_urls:'w'} or {'IMAP4'|link_urls:'w'} protocols.</p>
        <p>Gmail initially started as an invitation-only beta release on 1 April 1, 2004 and it became available to the general public on 7 February 2007, though still in beta status at that time.</p>
        <p>The service was upgraded from beta status on 7 July 2009, along with the rest of the Google Apps suite.</p>
        <p>With an initial storage capacity offer of 1GB per user, Gmail significantly increased the webmail standard for free storage from the 2 to 4MB its competitors such as {'Hotmail'|link_urls:'w'} offered at that time.</p>
        <p>Individual Gmail messages, including attachments, may be up to 25MB.</p>
        <p>Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum.</p>
        <p>Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of {'AJAX'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
