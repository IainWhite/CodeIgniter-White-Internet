        <p><strong>Erwise</strong> was a pioneering {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'}, and the first commonly available with a graphical user interface.</p>
        <p>Released in April 1992, the browser was written for {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} computers running X and used the W3 common access library.</p>
        <p>Erwise was the combined master's project of four Finnish students at the Helsinki University of Technology: Kim Nyberg, Teemu Rantanen, Kati Suominen and Kari Syd√§nmaanlakka.</p>
        <p>The group decided to create a web browser at the suggestion of {'Robert Cailliau'|link_urls:'/p'}, who was visiting the university and were supervised by Ari Lemmke.</p>
        <p>The development of Erwise halted after the students graduated and went on to other projects. {'Tim Berners-Lee'|link_urls:'/p'}, the creator of the {'World Wide Web'|link_urls:'w'}, travelled to Finland to encourage the group to continue with the project. However, none of the project members could afford to continue with the project without proper funding.</p>
