        <p><strong>Presto</strong> was the {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'} of the {'Opera'|link_urls:'w'} web browser for a decade.</p>
        <p>It was released on 28 January 2003 in Opera 7, for {'Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, after several public betas and technical previews.</p>
        <p>In Opera 15, the browser's developer Opera Software ASA began using the {'Blink'|link_urls:'w'} layout engine and {'V8'|link_urls:'w'} {'JavaScript engine'|link_urls:'w'} combined with a modified {'Chromium'|link_urls:'w'} browser.</p>
        <p>Presto is a dynamic engine. Webpages could be re-rendered completely or partially in response to {'DOM'|link_urls:'w'} events.</p>
        <p>Its releases saw a number of bug fixes and optimizations to improve the speed of the {'ECMAScript'|link_urls:'/l'} ({'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'}) engine.</p>
        <p>It is proprietary software only available as a part of the Opera browsers.</p>
