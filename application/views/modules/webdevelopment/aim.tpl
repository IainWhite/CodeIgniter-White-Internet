        <p><strong>AOL Instant Messenger</strong> (<strong>AIM</strong>) is an instant messaging and presence computer program which uses the proprietary <strong>OSCAR</strong> instant messaging protocol and the <strong>TOC</strong> protocol to allow registered users to communicate in real time.</p>
        <p>AOL Instant Messenger was released by <strong>America Online ({'AOL'|link_urls:'/c'})</strong> in May 1997.</p>
        <p>Stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and is available for {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'}, Windows Mobile, {'Mac OS'|link_urls:'i'}, Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'}, BlackBerry OS.</p>
        <p>The standard protocol that AIM clients use to communicate is called <strong>Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime (OSCAR)</strong>.</p>
        <p>Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called TOC that lacks many of OSCAR's features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality.</p>
        <p>The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.</p>
        <p>In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental <strong>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol</strong> ({'XMPP'|link_urls:'w'}) support for AIM, allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source XMPP.</p>
        <p>However, in March 2008, this service was discontinued. As of May 2011, AOL offers limited XMPP support.</p>
