        <p><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong> is an open source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain complex {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} front-end applications in {'Java'|link_urls:'/l'}.</p>
        <p>Other than a few native libraries, everything is Java source that can be built on any supported platform with the included GWT build files. It is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0.</p>
        <p>GWT emphasizes reusable approaches to common web development tasks, namely asynchronous remote procedure calls, history management, bookmarking, UI abstraction, internationalization, and cross-browser portability.</p>
