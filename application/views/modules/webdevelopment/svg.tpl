        <p><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<strong>SVG</strong>) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.</p>
        <p>The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium ({'W3C'|link_urls:'/c'}) since 1999.</p>
        <p>SVG images and their behaviours are defined in {'XML'|link_urls:'w'} text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.</p>
        <p>As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, but are more often created with drawing software.</p>
        <p>All major modern web browsers including {'Mozilla Firefox'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Internet Explorer'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Google Chrome'|link_urls:'w'}, {'Opera'|link_urls:'w'}, and {'Safari'|link_urls:'w'} have at least some degree of SVG support and can render the mark-up directly.</p>
