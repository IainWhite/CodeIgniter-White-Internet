        <p>The <strong>Oracle Database</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Oracle {'RDBMS'|link_urls:'w'}</strong> or simply as <strong>Oracle</strong>) is an object-relational database management system produced and marketed by {'Oracle'|link_urls:'/c'} Corporation.</p>
        <p>Larry Ellison and two friends and former co-workers, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, started a consultancy called <strong>Software Development Laboratories (SDL)</strong> in 1977. SDL developed the original version of the Oracle software.</p>
        <p>The name <em>Oracle</em> comes from the code-name of a CIA funded project Ellison had worked on while previously employed by Ampex.</p>
