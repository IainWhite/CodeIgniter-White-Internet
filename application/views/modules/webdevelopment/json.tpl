        <p><strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong>, is a text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. Derived from the {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} scripting language, JSON is a language for representing simple data structures and associative arrays, called objects. Despite its relationship to JavaScript, JSON is language-independent, with parsers available for many languages.</p>
        <p>The JSON format was originally specified by {'Douglas Crockford'|link_urls:'/p'}. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.</p>
        <p>The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to {'XML'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
