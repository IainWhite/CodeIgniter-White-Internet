        <p><strong>Web Design</strong> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.</p>
        <p>The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design ({'UI'|link_urls:'i'}); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design ({'UX'|link_urls:'i'}); and search engine optimization ({'SEO'|link_urls:'w'}).</p>
        <p>Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.</p>
        <p>The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the {'front-end'|link_urls:'w'} (client side) design of a website including writing {'mark-up'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of {'Web Development'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web{'accessibility'|link_urls:'w'} guidelines.</p>
