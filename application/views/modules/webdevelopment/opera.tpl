        {'Opera'|helper:'page':'getLogo':'m':'gif':'left'}
        <p><strong>Opera</strong> is a {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'} developed by <strong>Opera Software</strong>.</p>
        <p>Opera uses the {'Blink'|link_urls:'w'} {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>Opera runs on {'Microsoft Windows'|link_urls:'i'} and {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'} operating systems.</p>
        <p>Users of {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'} must install earlier versions which have the {'Presto'|link_urls:'w'} layout engine.</p>
        <p>Opera editions are available for devices running the {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}, {'iOS'|link_urls:'i'}, Symbian, Maemo, Bada, BlackBerry and Windows Mobile operating systems, and {'Java ME'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>According to Opera Software, the browser had more than 350 million users worldwide (more than 270 million users with mobile versions) on December 2013.</p>
        <p>Opera has been noted for originating many features later adopted by other web browsers. A prominent example is <strong>Speed Dial</strong>.</p>
        <p>Opera began in 1994 as a research project at <strong>Telenor</strong>, the largest Norwegian telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>In 1995, it branched out into a separate company named Opera Software ASA.</p>
        <p>Opera was first released publicly with version 2.0 in 1996, which only ran on Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected hand-held devices, a project to port Opera to mobile device platforms was started in 1998.</p>
        <p>Opera 4.0, released in 2000, included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms.</p>
        <p>Up to this point, Opera was trialware and had to be purchased after the trial period ended. Version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of this requirement.</p>
        <p>Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users who had not paid for it. Later versions of Opera gave the user the choice of seeing banner ads or targeted text advertisements from {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'}.</p>
        <p>With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support for the browser came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).</p>
        <p>Among the new features introduced in version 9.1 (released in 2006) was fraud protection using technology from GeoTrust, a digital certificate provider, and PhishTank, an organization that tracks known phishing web sites.</p>
        <p>This feature was further improved and expanded in version 9.5, when GeoTrust was replaced with Netcraft, and malware protection from Haute Secure was added.</p>
        <p>Also in 2006, Opera Software ASA released <strong>Internet Channel</strong> and <strong>Nintendo DS Browser</strong> for <strong>Nintendo's DS</strong> and <strong>Wii</strong> gaming systems.</p>
        <p>A new {'JavaScript engine'|link_urls:'w'} called <strong>Carakan</strong>, after the Javanese alphabet, was introduced with version 10.50.</p>
        <p>According to Opera Software, Carakan makes Opera 10.50 more than seven times faster in SunSpider than Opera 10.10.</p>
        <p>On 16 December 2010, Opera 11 was released, featuring extensions, tab stacking, visual mouse gestures, and changes to the address bar.</p>
        <p>Opera 12 was released on 14 June 2012.</p>
        <p>On 12 February 2013, Opera announced it would drop its own Presto engine in favour of {'WebKit'|link_urls:'w'} as implemented by Google's {'Chrome'|link_urls:'w'} browser, using code from the {'Chromium'|link_urls:'w'} project.</p>
        <p>Opera Software also planned to contribute code to WebKit.</p>
        <p>On 3 April 2013, Google announced that it would fork components from WebKit to form a new rendering engine known as {'Blink'|link_urls:'w'}; the same day, Opera confirmed that it would follow Google in implementing Blink.</p>
        <p>On 28 May 2013, a beta release of Opera 15 was made available, the first version based on the Chromium project.</p>
        <p>Many distinctive features of the previous versions were dropped, and Opera Mail was separated into a standalone application derived from Opera 12.</p>

        <h2>Opera Mini</h2>
        <p>Opera Mini is a micro-browser designed primarily for mobile phones, but also for {'smartphones'|link_urls:'w'} and personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Versions up to 4 used the {'Java Me'|link_urls:'i'} platform, requiring the mobile device to be capable of running Java ME applications.</p>
        <p>The micro-browser began as a pilot project in 2005.</p>
        <p>After limited releases in Europe, it was officially launched worldwide on 24 January 2006.</p>
        <p>Opera Mini requests web pages through the Opera Software company's servers, which process and compress them before relaying the pages back to the mobile phone.</p>
        <p>This compression process reduces data transferred by up to 90% (depending upon content), increasing loading speed, and the pre-processing smooths compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones.</p>

        <h2>Desktop Versions</h2>
        
        {'Opera Logo 199x'|helper:'page':'getImage':'jpg':'centre'}
        
        <h3>Opera Version 2</h3>
        
        <p>Version 2.0, the first public release of Opera, was released as shareware in 1996.</p>
        <p>Due to popular demand, Opera Software showed interest in programming its browser for alternate operating systems such as {'Apple Macintosh'|link_urls:'i'}, QNX and {'BeOS'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>On 10 October 1997, they launched "<em>Project Magic</em>", an effort to determine who would be willing to purchase a copy of their browser in their native OS, and to properly distribute funds to develop or outsource for such operating systems.</p>
        <p>On 30 November 1997 they closed voting for which operating system to develop with. Project Magic then became a news column for updates for alternate operating systems until version 4.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 3</h3>
        {'Opera Logo 1998'|helper:'page':'getImage':'gif':'left'}
        <p>Opera 3 was the first version of Opera with {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} support, but {'Java'|link_urls:'w'} was still missing.</p>
        <p>It was released for multiple operating systems on 31 December 1997.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Opera 3.5 was released, adding <strong>Cascading Style Sheets ({'CSS'|link_urls:'w'})</strong> support and file upload capability.</p>
        <p>Since version 3.5, Opera has supported CSS, and <strong>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</strong>, one of the inventors of CSS, is the CTO at Opera.</p>
        <p>Up to 6.0 Opera supported most common web standards, {'Netscape'|link_urls:'w'} plugins and some other recent standards such as WAP and WML for wireless devices, but its implementation of advanced {'ECMAScript'|link_urls:'/l'} (better known as "JavaScript") and the {'HTML'|link_urls:'w'} Document Object Model ({'DOM'|link_urls:'w'})was poor.</p>
        <p>Version 3.6 was released on 12 May 1999.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 4</h3>
        <p>On 28 June 2000, Opera 4 for Windows (<em>Elektra</em>) was released, introducing a new cross-platform core, and a new integrated e-mail client.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 5</h3>
        {'Opera Logo 2000'|helper:'page':'getImage':'png':'left'}
        <p>Opera 5, released on 6 December 2000, was the first version which was ad-sponsored instead of having a trial period.</p>
        <p>Version 5 also supported {'ICQ'|link_urls:'w'}, but this was dropped from later versions.</p>
        <p>Opera supported {'OS/2'|link_urls:'i'} for the first time, requiring WarpIN and Odin to be installed.</p>
        <p>Opera 5.10 (April 2001) was the first version to recognize mouse gestures, but this feature was disabled by default.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 6</h3>
        <p>On 29 November 2001, Opera 6 was released with new features including Unicode support, and offering a single document interface as well as the multiple document interface allowed by previous versions.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 7</h3>
        <p>On 28 January 2003, Opera 7 was released, introducing the new "{'Presto'|link_urls:'w'}" {'layout engine'|link_urls:'w'}, with improved CSS, client-side scripting, and Document Object Model (DOM) support. Mac OS 9 support was dropped.</p>
        <p>Version 7.0 saw Opera undergo an extensive rewrite with the faster and more powerful Presto layout engine.</p>
        <p>The new engine brought almost full support for the HTML DOM meaning that parts of, or a whole, page can be re-rendered in response to DOM and script events.</p>
        <p>A 2004 review in The Washington Post described Opera 7.5 as being excessively complex and difficult to use.</p>
        <p>The review also criticized the free edition's use of obtrusive advertisements when other browsers such as {'Mozilla'|link_urls:'w'} and {'Safari'|link_urls:'w'} were offered free of charge without including advertisements.</p>
        <p>In August 2004, Opera 7.6 began limited alpha testing. It had more advanced standards support, and introduced voice support for Opera, as well as support for Voice XML.</p>
        <p>Opera also announced a new browser for Interactive Television, which included a fit to width option Opera 8 introduced.</p>
        <p>Fit to Width is a technology that initially utilized the power of CSS, but it is now internal Opera technology.</p>
        <p>Pages are dynamically resized by making images and/or text smaller, and even removing images with specific dimensions to make it fit on any screen width, improving the experience on smaller screens dramatically.</p>
        <p>Opera 7.6 was never officially released as a final version.</p>
        <p>On 12 January 2005, Opera Software announced that it would offer free licenses to higher education institutions, a change from the previous cost of $1,000 USD for unlimited licenses.</p>
        <p>Schools that opted for the free license included Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, University of Oxford, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Duke University.</p>
        <p>Opera was commonly criticized for having been ad-sponsored, since this was seen as a barrier to gaining market share.</p>
        <p>In the newer versions the user was allowed a choice of generic graphical banners, or text-based targeted advertisements provided by {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'} based upon the page being viewed.</p>
        <p>Users could pay a license fee to remove the advertisement bar.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 8</h3>
        <p>On 19 April 2005, version 8.0 was released.</p>
        <p>Besides supporting SVG Tiny, multimodal features and User JavaScript, the default user interface was cleaned up and simplified.</p>
        <p>The default home page was an improved search portal.</p>
        <p>The changes displeased a number of existing users since some advanced settings became hidden.</p>
        <p>Version 8.0 introduced support for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> ({'SVG'|link_urls:'w'}) 1.1 Tiny. This marked the first major web browser to natively support some form of SVG.</p>
        <p>Version 8.5 was released on 20 September 2005.</p>
        <p>Opera announced that their browser would be available free of charge and without advertisements, although the company still continued to sell support contracts.</p>
        <p>Enhancements included automatic client-side fixing of web sites that did not render correctly, and a number of security fixes.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 9</h3>
        <p>Version 9.0 was the first Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and BSD browser to pass the <strong>Acid2</strong> test.</p>
        <p>This version, released on 20 June 2006, added {'XSLT'|link_urls:'w'} and improved SVG to 1.1 Basic level.</p>
        <p>Beta versions of Opera 9 included an Easter egg that, when triggered, affects the Acid2 test.</p>
        <p>After the page has been open for a while, the eyes of the smiley will follow the cursor around and when the user clicks on the eyes, a {'JavaScript'|link_urls:'/l'} alert will read "<em>Because just passing is not enough ;)</em>".</p>
        <p>The changes to the Acid2 code were applied using Opera's <code>browser.js</code> feature, and remain available in a separate User JavaScript file.</p>
        <p>Opera introduced Widgets, small web applications, a built-in BitTorrent client, improved content blocking and a built-in tool for creating and editing search engines.</p>
        <p>Opera also added ability to read {'MHTML'|link_urls:'w'} and to save the web page as archives.</p>
        <p>Version 9.1 (released in 2006) introduced fraud protection using technology from GeoTrust, a digital certificate provider, and PhishTank, an organization that tracks known phishing web sites.</p>
        <p>Version 9.2, codenamed <em>Merlin</em>, introduced Speed Dial, 3x3 small thumbnails which are shown instead of a blank page.</p>
        <p>Version 9.5, codenamed <em>Kestrel</em> (after the Kestrel falcon), was released to span the gap between Opera 9.2 and Opera 10.</p>
        <p>It included some of the rendering improvements due to be made in Opera 10 and also aimed to provide better integration with various operating systems.</p>
        <p>The first alpha build of Opera 9.5 was released on 4 September 2007.</p>
        <p>The first public beta was released on 25 October 2007, and the final version was released on 12 June 2008.</p>
        <p>The final release was downloaded more than 4.5 million times in the first 5 days.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 has improved support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), including many more {'CSS-3'|link_urls:'w'} selectors and the CSS2 text-shadow property.</p>
        <p>Support for other web standards was also improved. For example, Opera 9.5's Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation supports 93.8% of the W3C's SVG test suite, and built-in support for Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) and MathML.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 also supports high-security Extended Validation Certificates and added malware protection through partnership with Haute Secure.</p>
        <p>The interface underwent a few alterations as well. Using "Sharp" by default, a new skin designed to be more intuitive, though the classic skin was still available as a user preference.</p>
        <p>Screen reader support has been added back in. Opera's mail client, Opera Mail, has been updated, with an improved indexing feature and many bugfixes.</p>
        <p>Opera 9.5 also lets users save bookmarks, notes, the Personal Bar and Speed Dial settings to the Opera Link service.</p>
        <p>These preferences can then be synchronized with another Opera browser, such as a copy of Opera Mini running on a mobile phone.</p>
        <p>Alongside the new features, Opera 9.5 had new performance improvements. For example, x64-bit editions of Opera for compatible Linux and BSD operating systems. On the other hand, SPARC Linux support has been dropped.</p>
        <p>Version 9.6 improved Opera Link with the new opportunity to sync custom search engines and typed history. Feed preview and an updated Opera Mail client were additional changes.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 10</h3>
        {'Opera Logo 2009'|helper:'page':'getImage':'png':'left'}
        <p>Version 10 (<em>Peregrine</em>) debuted in a first beta version on 3 June 2009 and scored 100/100 on the <strong>Acid3</strong> test, but failed the smoothness criteria.</p>
        <p>There was also a preview build that scored 100/100, released on 28 March 2009.</p>
        <p>Among other features, it also came with speed optimizations, in-line spell checking for forms, an auto update feature, HTML mail formatting, web fonts and SVG font support, alpha transparency support using the RGBA and HSLA colour models, and an updated version of the {'Opera Dragonfly'|link_urls:'w'} web debugger.</p>
        <p><strong>Opera Turbo</strong>, a mode which uses Opera's servers as proxy servers with data compression, reducing volume of data transferred by up to 80% (depending upon content), and thus increasing speed, was introduced.</p>
        <p>Opera 10 was officially released on 1 September 2009. Within a week of release, 10 million downloads had been recorded.</p>
        <p>The 10.5x versions (codenamed <em>Evenes</em>) also came with a new JavaScript engine, <strong>Carakan</strong>, and a new graphics back-end dubbed <strong>Vega</strong> (replacing the previously used Qt), that have increased its speed measurably.</p>
        <p>Then version 10.60, which Opera Software claims to be 50% faster than Opera 10.50, which also brought up new features like Geolocation, WebM support, AVG malware protection, Speed Dial improvements, etc.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 11</h3>
        <p>Opera 11 (codenamed <em>Kjevik</em>) was released on 16 December 2010 with new features including extensions, tab stacking, visual mouse gestures, new installer (Windows only) and safety improvements to the address field.</p>
        <p>In addition, the content blocker list now can be synchronized through Opera Link. It also passes the Acid3 Test as of 22 January 22, 2011.</p>
        <p>On 12 April 2011, Opera 11.10 (codenamed <em>Barracuda</em>) was released. It contains many fixes "under the hood", such as improved Turbo Mode, a plug-in installation wizard and a rewritten Speed Dial. Opera 11.10 was updated to use the new Presto 2.8 Rendering Engine.</p>
        <p>On 18 May 2011, the final version of Opera 11.11 was released with improvements to security.</p>
        <p>On 28 June 2011, Opera 11.50 (codename <em>Swordfish</em>) was released.</p>
        <p>Equipped with the rendering engine Presto 2.9.168 featuring up to 20% faster rendering of CSS and SVG, support for {'HTML5'|link_urls:'w'} tags , Session History and Navigation, it also features extensions in the Speed Dial, support for password sync in Opera Link and an updated {'UI'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>On 6 December 2011, Opera 11.60 (codename <em>Tunny</em>) was released.</p>
        <p>Updated with the newest rendering engine Presto 2.10.229, this update features several changes including a UI revamp of the email interface, a new address field with star feature, and several "under the hood" as new HTML5 tags and parsing implementations, full ECMAScript 5.1 support.</p>
        <p>This version also implemented the JSON API geo-location of Google.</p>

        <p>On 17 April 2012, Opera 11.63 was released. It was a Mac-exclusive release, contrary to belief that {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} had prematurely flipped the switch, making this release available for Mac users ahead of Windows and Linux customers.</p>
        <p>On May 10, 2012, Opera 11.64 was released, with stability, bug fixes and security improvements.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 12</h3>
        <p>Opera released version 12 Pre-Alpha Build 1017 on 7 June 2011.</p>
        <p>Its code name was <em>Wahoo</em>.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 15</h3>
        <p>On 12 February 2013, Opera Software announced their intention to transition from their Presto layout engine to {'WebKit'|link_urls:'w'}, building upon the base of the {'Chromium'|link_urls:'w'} project.</p>
        <p>After the announcement of transition from WebKit to {'Blink'|link_urls:'w'} by {'Google'|link_urls:'/c'}, Opera confirmed it would also switch to Blink instead of WebKit.</p>
        <p>The version identifier 13 was skipped, thought to be for reasons of superstition, while 14 was used to refer to a WebKit based release of Opera for {'Android'|link_urls:'i'}.</p>
        <p>On 28 May 2013, a beta version of Opera 15 containing Blink was made available for Windows and Mac computers.</p>
        <p>It removed many distinctive Opera features, including some ubiquitous features like bookmarks (with an expanded Speed Dial intended to replace this feature).</p>
        <p>The features confirmed to be restored in the near future were synchronization, theme support, geolocation, and a "feature rich" tab bar.</p>
        <p>The previously-bundled M2 email client was released as a standalone application, Opera Mail.</p>
        <p>Extensions for the previous browser versions are no longer supported; instead developers are provided facilities for converting old extensions to Chrome extensions, supported in Opera 15.</p>
        <p>On 2 July 2013, the final version of Opera 15.0 was released. This release was not pushed through the automatic update system, as it was deemed some features important to current users had yet to be implemented.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 16</h3>
        <p>On 19 July 2013, Opera 16 entered the Next stream.</p>
        <p>This build included the return of geolocation support and automatic form filling, and added a flags page allowing experimental features to be enabled.</p>
        <p>On 27 August 2013, Opera 16 was released.</p>

        <h3>Opera Version 17</h3>
        <p>On 8 August 2013, Opera 17 entered the Developer stream, reintroducing rocker gestures, tab pinning, start-up options, and search engine management.</p>
        <p>On 6 September 2013, Opera 17 transitioned from the Developer stream to the Next stream in anticipation of its impending release.</p>
