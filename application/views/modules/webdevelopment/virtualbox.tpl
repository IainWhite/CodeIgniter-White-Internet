        <p><strong>Oracle VM VirtualBox</strong> (formerly <strong>Sun VirtualBox</strong>, <strong>Sun xVM VirtualBox</strong> and <strong>innotek VirtualBox</strong>), a virtualization software package for x86 and AMD64/Intel64-based computers from {'Oracle'|link_urls:'/c'} Corporation, forms part of Oracle's family of virtualization products. innotek GmbH first developed the product; Sun Microsystems purchased it in 2008; Oracle has continued development since 2010.</p>
        <p>The VirtualBox package installs on an existing host operating system as an application; this host application allows additional guest operating systems, each known as a Guest O/S, to load and run, each with its own virtual environment.</p>
        <p>Supported host operating systems include {'Linux'|link_urls:'i'}, Mac {'OS X'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows XP'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows Vista'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows 7'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Windows 8'|link_urls:'i'}, {'Solaris'|link_urls:'i'}, and OpenSolaris; there are also ports to {'FreeBSD'|link_urls:'i'} and Genode.</p>
        <p>Supported guest operating systems include versions and derivations of Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, Solaris, Haiku and others. Since release 3.2.0, VirtualBox also allows limited virtualization of Mac OS X guests on {'Apple'|link_urls:'/c'} hardware, though OSX86 can also be installed using VirtualBox.</p>
        <p>Since version 4.3 (released in October 2013), Microsoft Windows guests on supported hardware can take advantage of the recently implemented WDDM driver included in the guest additions; this allows Windows Aero to be enabled along with Direct3D support.</p>
        <p>Guest Additions should be installed in order to achieve the best possible experience. The Guest Additions can be installed inside a virtual machine after the installation of the guest operating system. They consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability.</p>
