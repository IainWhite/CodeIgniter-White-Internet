        <p><strong>ViolaWWW</strong> was first developed in the early 1990s, for {'Unix'|link_urls:'i'} and the <strong>X Windowing System</strong>, was the first popular {'web browser'|link_urls:'w'}, though to a limited audience.</p>
        <p>Until {'Mosaic'|link_urls:'w'}, it was the most frequently used web browser for access to the{'world wide web'|link_urls:'w'}.</p>
        <p>For a year it was the recommended browser at {'CERN'|link_urls:'/c'}, where the Web was created.</p>
        <p>Viola was the invention of {'Pei-Yuan Wei'|link_urls:'/p'}, who at the time was a student at the <strong>Experimental Computing Facility</strong> at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Viola was a UNIX-based programming / scripting language; the acronym stood for "Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application".</p>
        <p>Pei's interest in graphically based software began with HyperCard, which he first encountered in 1989. Of that, Pei said, "<em>HyperCard was very compelling back then, you know graphically, this hyperlink thing, it was just not very global and it only worked on Mac ... and I didn't even have a Mac</em>".</p>
        <p>Only having access to X terminals, Pei, in 1990, created the first version of Viola for such terminals: "<em>I got a HyperCard manual and looked at it and just basically took the concepts and implemented them ...</em>".</p>
        <p>Pei released Viola 0.8 in 1991.</p>
