        <p><strong>Slash</strong> (a recursive acronym: <strong>S</strong>lashdot-<strong>L</strong>ike <strong>A</strong>utomated <strong>S</strong>torytelling <strong>H</strong>omepage) is a powerful Content Management System ({'CMS'|link_urls:'w'}), written in {'Perl'|link_urls:'/l'}, originally created for {'Slashdot'|link_urls:'w'}, one of most popular and oldest collaborative sites on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Early versions of Slash were written by <strong>Rob Malda</strong>, founder of Slashdot, in the spring of 1998. After <strong>Andover.net</strong> bought Slashdot in June 1999, several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased from a few hundred to tens of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001.</p>
        <p>Currently, Slash is maintained by Jamie McCarthy and Chris Nandor, among others. It is Free software and anyone can contribute to development.</p>
        <p>Slash is often incorrectly called <em>Slashcode</em>, which is the name of the project's web site.</p>
